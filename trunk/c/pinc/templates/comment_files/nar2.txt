<p>This is a second-time for this text to be proofed. Many small errors 
remained after the normal 2 rounds of proofing, so we are trying to 
eliminate them prior to post processing.</p>
<p>Two common reasons for these remaining errors are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The images are copies (of copies of...) typewritten material. They 
are  difficult to see unless you proof with at least 100% zoom.</li>
<li>The vernacular means you cannot assume anything about a word's 
spelling. Reading is not sufficient, you have to compare to the image. Many 
people are finding it best to start at the bottom and work backwards so 
they do not get trapped by reading such interesting content.</li>
</ul>

   <dd>If spelling or punctuation was corrected in
   handwriting, simply make the correction. If, however, a word or phrase
   was added insert it like [HW: this ] or if a question mark was
   inserted mark it[HW:?].

   <br /><dt><font size="+1">Transcriber's Comments:</font></dt><br />
   <dd>
   If, for example, a sentence was begun but not
   completed you would [TR: sentence unfinished]. Or if a word was
   illegible you would mark it [TR: illegible] or if you're not sure of
   it 1883[TR:?]. That's a Transcriber's Comment done by you, as opposed
   to a Handwritten Comment done by an editor.
<br /><br />
<u>Please</u> be careful about removing any Transcriber's Comments in 
second round. They are not difficult to remove in PP and, in general, are 
helpful. If you're doing second round and want to add a comment, that's great.

document:</font></dt><br />
   <dd>
   You will encounter many of these. The post-processor
   will have to make decisions on what to correct and what to leave as is
   based on many factors. If definitely not part of dialect, mark
   such words with * to be sure they're noticed.

   <br /><dt><font size="+1">Difficult to spot errors from the 
OCR:</font></dt><br />
   <dd>
   <ul>
     <li>"Stealth Scannos": For example, "He" and "We" are both valid words 
often mistaken for each
         other when the OCR interpreted the typewriter print. "Dey" or 
"dey" (dialect for "they") is often
         presented as "day" from the OCR software. Look very carefully at 
the scans while you are
         proofing. <em>Only people can find these!</em>
         </li>
         <li>Dialect: You will find examples of both "wuz" and "waz", and 
"chillun" and "chillen"; only
         a careful check against the scan can tell you which is used in any 
one instance.
     </li>
         <li>Check carefully for "1"/"l"/"I"/"!" (digit-one / 
lower-case-ell / upper-case-eye / exclamation-mark)
         and "0"/"O"/"o" (digit-zero / upper-case-oh / lower-case-oh).
         They look alike in some fonts, but don't be fooled. "0h!" is *not* 
a word ... fix it to be "Oh!"
         "We'!1" shoud be "We'll".
         </li>
         <li>The OCR commonly mistook the letter B (upper-case B) for a
         "B (double-quote, upper-case B). Please keep an eye out for this.
         </li>
         <li>Some combinations of letters are more likely to have been 
missed in the first proofing
         rounds. Combinations that tend to misscan:  <br />
         Kl&#8594;KL,  li&#8594;ll,  ch&#8594;oh,  rn&#8596;m</li>
         <li>Some individual scannos that were often missed in the first 
proofing rounds are: <br />
         e&#8596;a,  e&#8596;s,  s&#8594;a,  c&#8596;o,  h&#8594;n, 
M&#8596;N,  H&#8596;M,  W&#8594;v,  W&#8594;w,  I&#8594;i</li>
         <li>Perhaps because of so many dialect words, another commonly 
missed problem was a missing "i", e.g. "takng"

   <ul>
         <li>Comma/period errors, especially commas at ends of sentences.</li>
         <li>Extra comma next to period.</li>
         <li>Periods sometimes scan as "^".</li>
         <li>Extraneous quote marks may appear before letters with leading 
lines, like "W" or "N".</li>
         <li>Watch quotes in general, also check single/double quote 
match-ups.</li>
         <li>Apostrophes ("'") sometimes scan as "l" or "f", e.g. "Ilse" 
should be "I'se".</li>
         <li>Exclamation marks ("!") often scan as lower-case-ell ("l") or 
digit-one ("1").</li>

   <br /><dt><font size="+1">Underlines:</font></dt><br />
   <dd>
   A few instances of acutual underlining appear in the text.  Mark words 
underlined for emphasis
   "<font color="#800000"><</font><font color="#800000">u>word<</font><font 
color="#800000">/u></font>".
Sometimes it looks like someone just randomly underlined words on a page ...
   reading with a pencil trailing. Don't keep these underlines.

   <dd>
   If two upper-case initials separated put them together, e.g. "A.H. Jones"

   <br /><dt><font size="+1">New Paragraph at start of page:</font></dt><br />
   <dd>
   If you don't mind, you can do something that will be helpful in post 
processing.
   If the first line on the page is definitely a new paragraph, add a blank 
line before it.

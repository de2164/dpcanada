<b>To the post-processor:</b>
An HTML edition of this is required. We don't yet have any set standards for
HTML, although these are being developed. In the mean time, make sure that
whatever you produce satisfied the following:
<ul>
<li>Please make sure that the HTML validates to at least XHTML 1.0
transitional.
<li>Anchors should be made named 'pageXXX', enabling the reader to jump
straight to a particular page.
<li>If the project has an index, then this index should be formatted as a
nested list, and the page numbers listed should be linked to the page anchors
you've already created.
<li>Edition and printing information should be retained.
<li>Please check the list of images (follow the 'View Images Online' link on
the post-processing page). Any illustrations will have been scanned in
seperately in grayscale or colour, and will generally have been named
<tt>imageXX.png</tt>. These images should be incorporated into the final HTML
edition.
</ul>

# Project Manager file prep tool to be used on the raw OCR output files
#
# AUTHOR: D. Garcia (for Distributed Proofreading) 12/15/2002
#
# AUTOMATIC FUNCTIONS:
#  Removes end-of-line hyphenation and joins words.
#  Marks "last line last word" hypen with asterisk.
#  Removes start/end-of-line spaces.
#  Collapses multiple adjacent spaces.
#  Removes spaces before ,.:"!?) punctuation.
#  Removes spaces before common contractions.
#  Inserts "[Blank Page]" text into zero-byte files.
#
# CONTROLLABLE FUNCTIONS:
#  Fixes common scannos with -c (corrections) switch. (default OFF)
#  Analyze and strip header lines with -s (strip) switch. (default OFF)
#  The -s option tells the script to analyze the first line by word freqency and capitalization.
#
# BUGS:
#  De-hyphenation does not work properly on texts which scanned as doublespaced lines
#  Doesn't check de-hyphenated words for scannos. (not a big deal)
#  Does not (YET) check words with punctuation for scannos.
#  Data should eventually be moved into separate files for ease of maintenance
#  Script needs to be in the path, or called with explicit pathing.
#
# CAVEATS:
#  Probably shouldn't be used on text that isn't primarily English.
#  Assumes ALL *.txt files in current directory are to be processed, should set.
#  Assumes DOS-style CRLF for rewriting line endings.

# =============================================================================
# Following this is the scanno correction pairs list:
#
# Ambiguous scannos are marked with an asterisk, not corrected.
#
# Word list derived from Moby project data, cut for top 2000 frequency and word
# of 6 characters or less (to reduce size and assuming that longer words will
# be closely examined by the proofreaders). The resulting list was processed
# through perl scripts which generated scannos by replacement (see below).
# This result was then filtered to eliminate valid words from the generated
# "error" list (left side) to eliminate false positives.
#
# The common scannos from gutcheck and PRTK were then added, as well as some
# additional scannos provided by numerous DP proofreaders.
#
# The resulting list was then tested against just over 1 million words of raw
# OCR output provided by charlz. Further false positives were discovered and
# removed. The actual hit rate for this code is about 1 scanno detected per 30k
# words of input text. The actual accuracy rate against the corpus provided by
# charlz is: 2 false positives out of 122 scannos detected, or 98.3% accurate.
# Seems worthwhile to me. :)
#
# The scanno generation: (correct/incorrect)
# Bidirectional: b/h u/n rn/m li/h
# Unidirectional: y/v e/c 1/l 0/o 9/g

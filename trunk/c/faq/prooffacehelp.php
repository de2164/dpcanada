<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
To understand the interface,
you need to understand the following Q &amp; A.

<p>
<b>Q</b>:
Where do my pages go?

<p>
<b>A</b>:
There are four possible destinations in the system
for the pages that you proofread.
They are:

<ul>
    <li>
    <b><a name=done>"DONE"</a></b>:
    All final changes are saved, and proofreading is completed.
    These pages are ready to go to the next round.
    There are links to the five most recent pages in this category
    on the Project Comments page, under the heading "DONE".
    These pages can be re-opened for corrections if necessary
    by clicking on the individual links.
    Do not mark a page "DONE" unless you have really finished correcting it,
    or else this partially-proofread page may move to the next round
    when the rest of the project does!
    </li>
    <br>

    <li>
    <b><a name=progr>"IN PROGRESS"</a></b>:
    Changes made so far are saved, but proofreading is not yet completed.
    These pages are not yet ready to go the next round.
    There are links to the five most recent pages in this category
    on the Project Comments page, under the heading "IN PROGRESS".
    These pages are waiting for you to complete them;
    you can do so by clicking on the individual links
    to re-open them and finish the proofreading.
    If you do not complete them,
    eventually the system will reclaim them for someone else to proofread.
    </li>
    <br>

    <li>
    <b><a name=return>"RETURN TO SENDER"</a></b>
    All changes are abandoned,
    original version of page made available for someone else to proofread.
    This is for pages that, once you saw them,
    you decided you didn't want to or couldn't proofread,
    but that someone else might be able to.
    Whoever next clicks on the "Start Proofing" link for this project
    will get the page to proofread.
    </li>
    <br>

    <li>
    <b><a name=bad>"BAD"</a></b>
    All changes abandoned, page is unproofably damaged or flawed
    and is made unavailable until it can be repaired by the Project Manager.
    </li>

</ul>

<p>
When you open a page for proofreading,
it is automatically <a href="#progr">"IN PROGRESS"</a>
</p>

<p>
Now you will understand the following explanations of what the buttons do.
</p>

<hr>

<?

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

$help = Array();

$help["Save as 'Done'"] = "
<p>
    <i>\"I have finished proofreading this page,
    it is as correct as I can make it,
    so I want to save it as <a href='#done'>DONE</a>,
    and stop proofreading for now.\"</i>
</p>
<p>
    Save all changes, and finish proofreading the current page.
    The page is now <a href='#done'>DONE</a>.
    Stop proofreading.
    The proofreading browser window will close.
</p>
";

$help["Save as 'Done' & Proof Next"] = "
<p>
    <i>\"I have finished proofreading this page,
    it is as correct as I can make it,
    so I want to save it as <a href='#done'>DONE</a>,
    and start proofreading the next available page.\"</i>
</p>
<p>
    Save all changes, and finish proofreading the current page.
    The page is now <a href='#done'>DONE</a>.
    The next available page within the project, if any,
    will be opened for proofreading.
</p>
";

$help["Save as 'In Progress'"] = "
<p>
    <i>\"I haven't finished proofreading this page,
    but I want to save my work on it so far.\"</i>
</p>
<p>
    Save changes to the current page.
    The page is now <a href='#progr'>IN PROGRESS</a>.
    This button is intended to temporarily save your work so far
    on a page you plan to finish later,
    perhaps because it is too long or you are interrupted.
    You will be repositioned to the start of the page.
</p>
";

$help['Stop Proofing'] = "
<p>
    <i>\"I haven't finished proofreading this page,
    but I want to stop proofreading for now.
    I will finish proofreading this page later.\"</i>
</p>
<p>
    Closes the proofreading interface without saving the current page.
    The page will be <a href='#progr'>IN PROGRESS</a>.
    To save your most recent changes before quitting,
    use the \"Save as 'In Progress'\" button first.
    Note that \"Save as 'In Progress'\" followed by 'Stop Proofing'
    (page is left <a href='#progr'>IN PROGRESS</a>)
    is NOT equivalent to \"Save as 'Done'\"
    (page is left <a href='#done'>DONE</a>).
</p>
";

$help['Report Bad Page'] = "
<p>
    <i>\"This page is damaged or flawed so badly no one could proofread it.\"</i>
</p>
<p>
    Loads the Report Bad Page form.
</p>
<p>
    Rarely, some damaged pages are unproofable.
    For instance, the image may be incomplete or unreadable,
    or the OCR text may be from a different image.
    In these cases, where some repairs have to be made to the files
    by the Project Manager,
    the page can be marked 'Bad' and removed from proofreading until fixed.
    Further information
    (including how to tell a truly bad page from a false alarm)
    is available on the Report Bad Page form itself.
    If you press the 'Submit Report' button on the Bad Page Report form,
    the page is now <a href='#bad'>BAD</a>;
    if you press the 'Cancel' button instead,
    the page is <a href='#progr'>IN PROGRESS</a>.
</p>
";

$help['Return Page to Round'] =
$help['Return Page to Current Round'] = "
<p>
    <i>\"This page is more than I can (or want to) proofread at the moment,
    but someone else may have better luck.\"</i>
</p>
<p>
    Abandons any changes you have made to the current page,
    and returns the original version
    to the top of the pile of available pages for this project,
    waiting for the next proofreader
    who requests a new page to proofread from this project,
    to whom it will go for proofreading.
    (See <a href='#return'>RETURN TO SENDER</a>.)
</p>
<p>
    If a page seems too long or complex for you,
    you can return it to round for someone else to do.
    (Note if you then immediately request a new page to proofread,
    the 'someone else' may be you!
    If you don't want to go proofread a different project instead,
    you can \"Save as 'In Progress'\" the page, 'Stop Proofing' and follow the 'Start Proofing' link.
    This will load the next available page,
    leaving the one you wanted to skip in your 'IN PROGRESS' section.
    When you have finished proofreading for the day,
    you can re-open it from there and press 'Return Page to Current Round'
    to immediately make it available for someone else to proofread.)
</p>
";

$help['Spell Check'] =
$help['Run Spelling Check'] = "
<p>
    <i>\"I want to check this page with the automatic spell checker.\"</i>
</p>
<p>
    Loads the Spelling Check form.
    The OCR text is run through a spell-checker and then displayed,
    with doubtful words rendered as
    a drop down list of suggested corrected spellings from which you can select.
</p>
<p>
    When done, the corrections made can be submitted (applied) or cancelled.
</p>
<p>
    In either case the page is <a href='#progr'>IN PROGRESS</a>.
</p>
";

$help['Switch to Vertical/Horizontal'] = "
<p>
    <i>\"I'd rather the image was to the left of / above the text.\"</i>
</p>
<p>
    Toggles your interface layout between
    vertical mode
    (scanned image of page appears to the LEFT of the OCR text you are correcting)
    and
    horizontal mode
    (scanned image of page appears ABOVE the OCR text you are correcting).
    On the way, it performs a 'SAVE'.
    The page is <a href='#progr'>IN PROGRESS</a>.
</p>
";

$help['Help'] = "
<p>
    Opens this page in a new window.

	ALT='Change Interface Layout'
	TITLE='Change Interface Layout'
	WIDTH='26' HEIGHT='26' BORDER='0' ALIGN='LEFT'>
    When in horizontal mode,
    clicking this button will switch you to vertical mode

    <IMG SRC='../tools/proofers/gfx/bt5.png'
	ALT='Change Interface Layout'
	TITLE='Change Interface Layout'

    When in vertical mode,
    clicking this button will switch you to horizontal mode
    (scanned image of page appears ABOVE the OCR text you are correcting).
</p>
<p>
    On the way, it performs a 'SAVE'.
    The page is <a href='#progr'>IN PROGRESS</a>.
</p>
";

$help['Check for Common Errors'] = "
<p>
    Interactively searches the current text for common errors.
<p>
    To <b>start</b> the error checking sequence,
    click the Check for Common Errors Button.
    The error check messages will replace the text in the text editing area.
<p>
    To <b>stop</b> the error checking sequence,
    click the Undo Revert button
    to restore to the last edit before starting the common errors check.
    Any changes made during the check will be lost.
<p>
    To <b>continue</b> the error checking process
    after any prompt message in the text editing area,
    click the Check for Common Errors button.
<p>
    If an error is found, the discovery of the error and type of error
    will be displayed in the text editing area.
    Click the check for common errors button to show the location of the error.
    The error will be located at the end of the text editing area and,
    depending upon the location of the error in the text,
    may require you to scroll to end of the text editing area
    to see the potential error.
    Once you have fixed the error or determined that it is not an error,
    click the Check for Common Errors button
    to continue the error checking sequence.
<p>
    When the error checking sequence is complete,
    click the Check for Common Errors button
    to replace the error check messages with the text.
    Changes made during the error checking process will be included in the text.
    If you wish to undo any changes made during the process,
    click the Undo Revert button
    to restore to your last edit before starting
    the Check for Common Errors sequence.
<p>
    The Check for Common Errors sequence
    <em>does not</em> replace the need for manual proofreading.
";

$help['View Project Comments'] = "
<p>
    Opens a copy of the Project Manager's Project Comments
    (NOT the full 'Project Comments' page)
    in a new browser window for reference.
";

$help['Show All Text'] = "
<p>
    Displays the currently edited text from the text area in a new window.
";

$help['Undo Revert'] = "
<p>
    Undoes the Revert to Original Document function
    by restoring to the last edit before Reverting to Original Document.
<!--
<p>
    Also stops the Check for Common Errors cycle
    and reverts back to the last edit
    before initiating the Check for Common Errors.
-->
";

$help['Revert to Original Document'] = "
<p>
    When working with a new page,
    this reverts to the original, unedited document.
    After saving an edit via the save button,
    this will revert to the last save.
";

$help['Refresh Image'] = "
<p>
    Reloads the image file of the scanned page.
    Useful if the image 'gets stuck'
    and doesn't load completely the first time;
    sometimes it makes an apparently 'missing' image 'reappear'.
";

$help['Set Image Zoom Percent'] = "
<p>
    Type a number as a percent into the box to the left of this button
    and then click this button to zoom the scanned image width
    to the percent indicated.
<p>
    All percentages are calculated using 1000 pixels=100% width.
<p>
    Please, <B>do not</B> include the percent (%) sign in your number.

<h4>Special Character Dropdowns</h4>

<p>
    Many non-English texts have characters
    that can be difficult to enter from the keyboard.
    There are six drop-down lists of non-ASCII characters
    to assist in these cases.
</p>
<p>
    The ones labelled A,E,I,O,U contain various accented versions,
    upper and lower case,
    of those respective characters.
    The final drop-down list contains other special symbols,
    and accented versions of some consonants like Y, C, D, N etc.
</p>
<p>
    For any of the dropdown lists, select the character you want.
    It should appear at the insertion point in the text area of the
    proofreading interface.
</p>
<p>
    Some people experience problems with these lists,
    such as not being able to select the same character twice in a row.
    We are aware of these difficulties and are working to solve them.
    A workaround is to select a different character in between,
    or copy-and-paste it from the earlier position (if still on the same page).
</p>
<p>
    Also see the Proofreading Guidelines
    for other ways of entering special characters.
</p>


<h4>Greek transliteration popup</h4>

<p>
    The most common non-Latin alphabet we encounter is Greek.
    We usually wish to transliterate Greek letters into Latin ones,
    and wrap the result in tags [Greek: ].
    So
	<blockquote>
	&beta;&iota;&beta;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;
	</blockquote>
    in the image is rendered
    <pre>
    [Greek: biblos]
    </pre>
    in our proofread page.
</p>
<p>
    To make it easier to select the correct transliterated characters,
    this tool has been provided.
    Click on the Greek button and a small window pops up,
    containing upper and lower case Greek alphabets and a text box.
</p>
<p>
    All of the Greek letters in the popup box are clickable.
    Click the ones that appear in the Greek word in the image,
    and the latin transliterations appear in the text box,
    from whence they can be cut-and-pasted into the proofread text
    and surrounded with [Greek: ] tags.
</p>
<p>
    For more information please see the Proofreading Guidelines.
</p>


<h4>Common Tags</h4>

<p>
    &lt;i&gt;,
    &lt;/i&gt; (<i>italic</i> text),
    &lt;b&gt;,
    &lt;/b&gt; (<b>bold</b> text),

    Along the lower line of the proofreading toolbar
    in the lower pane of the proofreading interface
    are controls labelled with the common tags listed above.
    You can use these buttons to place tags into the proofreading text area.
    If you select text before you click on a button in the toolbar, the text will be
    surrounded by the respective tag.
</p>
<p>
    The tags will also appear in the text boxes to the left of the Italic button. You 
    can also copy and paste the tags from the text box if the select and surround feature does not
    work in your browser.
    These features are provided as a convenience;
    if you'd really rather type the tags in by hand you are welcome to.
</p>
<p>
    For example, if the caption for an illustration is in your page,
    you can select the caption in the text box
    (by clicking your mouse at the start of the caption,
    and dragging the mouse to the end of the caption
    while keeping the button depressed),
    then click on the "Illustration" link in the proofreading toolbar,
    to have the desired tags inserted at the beginning and end of the caption.
</p>
<p>
    In cases where a common tag is singular
    (such as the 'thought break' row of asterisks),
    you can select, say, a space character in the text
    where you want the tag to be added,
    and it will be positioned there when you click the tag link.
</p>
<p>
    Note that [Blank Page] will clear any existing text in the proofreading window.

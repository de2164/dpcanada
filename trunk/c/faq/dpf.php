<h1>The Distributed Proofreaders Foundation Canada</h1>

<p>
This document provides some basic facts about the Distributed
Proofreaders Foundation Canada (DPFC). 
</p>

<h2>Mission:</h2>

<p>
The Distributed Proofreaders Foundation Canada has been formed to support the
Distributed Proofreaders Canada (DPC) website (www.pgdpcanada.net) which has existed 
since about September, 2007. DPC volunteers
transcribe books and periodicals that are in the public domain into
electronic texts using software that has been developed by DPC
volunteers. These electronic texts are freely distributed for the
benefit of anyone who can use them. 
</p>
<p>
While currently DPC only transcribes text into ebooks, related activities
that might be included on the existing website in the future, or
supported by DPFC in some fashion, include transcription of musical
notation, cooperative translation, and public access to the scanned
material produced by DPC volunteers. In this sense, DPFC's mission goes
beyond simple support of the DPC website to the wider goal of
transcribing, into digital form, freely distributable material that is
currently only available on paper.
</p>

<h2>Organization:</h2>

<p>
DPFC operates in the Province of Ontario. The office address is:
</p>

Suite 200
Markham ON L3P 3J3<br>

</p>

<h2>Tax Status:</h2>
<p>
DPFC will apply for charitable foundation status. 
</p>

<h2>Donations:</h2>

<p>
Until confirmation of our charitable staus is received, donations are not tax deductible,
but still greatly appreciated.
</p>

<h2>Use of Donations:</h2>

<p>
Money donated to DPFC will be used to support this website, and
other activities supportive of books in the public domain, as determined by the Board.
</p>
<p>
It is unlikely that DPC will have any paid staff in the foreseeable
future. Some software development may be contracted out, as necessary.
Funds raised by DPFC will be used to support the website, recruit new
volunteers, improve the custom software, buy additional hardware as
needed, and for such other items as the Board determines are
appropriate.

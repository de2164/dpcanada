<h2>Part 3</h2>

<h3>Chapter Headers</h3>
<p> Leave chapter headers in the text. A chapter header may start a bit farther down
    the page than the page header and won't have the page numbers
    on the same line.  Chapter Headers are often printed all caps; if so, keep them as
    all caps.</p>
 <p> 
    Put 4 blank lines before the "CHAPTER XXX". (Include these blank
    lines even if the chapter starts on a new page; there are no 'pages' in an e-book,
    so the blank lines are needed.) Then leave 1 blank line between each additional part
    of the chapter header, such as a chapter description, opening quote, etc., and
    finally leave 2 blank lines before the start of the text of the chapter.</p>
  <p>
    Old books often printed the first word or two of every chapter in all caps,
    sometimes even the first word or two of every paragraph; change these to upper
    and lower case (first letter only capitalized).</p>
  <p>
    Watch out for a missing double quote at the start of the first paragraph, which some
    publishers did not include or which the OCR missed due to a large capital in the
    original.  If the author started the paragraph with dialog, insert the double quote,
    even if the publisher left it out or used a large capital instead.
</p>

<h3>Punctuation characters</h3>
<p> In general, there is no space before punctuation characters (except the opening
    quote). Books typeset in the 1700's &amp; 1800's often had a partial space inserted
    before punctuation such as a semicolon or comma.  If scanned text has a space before
    punctuation, remove it. </p>

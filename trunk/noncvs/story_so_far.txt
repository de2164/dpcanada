And we start with:

One day, ...  
 only recently,  
 the amazing  
 blue sky   
 was falling  
 into a     
 very deep  
 sleep. Elston  
 was at     
 his customary  
 home in    
 jabber.org  
 dancing and  
 distributing chocolate,  
 and liquor  
 when suddenly  
 in ornate  
 splendor, the  
 cat came   
 bursting through  
 and said   
 : talking cats?  
 meow. meow?  
 But Ellston  
 could not  
 understand cattese.  
 On the     
 table, sat  
 Lady Electra  
 and a      
 crystal vase  
 containing milk.  
 Magical smoke  
 wafted from  
 the silver  
 mesh of    
 the gear-assembly







(wrenn punts the story back into motion...)  
 , slip-sliding unctuous  
 oil pouring  
 down the   
 back of    
 her neck   
 and carefully  
 upending the  
 teapot that  
 was brewing  
 unattended.  Then,  
 very slowly,  
 as if      
 he'd never  
 before seen  
 a frog     
 chocolate dipped  
 and rolled  
 in fly-wings,  
 Elston crept  
 across the  
 linoleum, opened  
 the back-door  
 , and looked  
 ravishing, dressed  
 in a       
 purple leather  
 motorcycle jacket.  
 No songbirds  
 or squirrels  
 ever contemplated  
 being so   
 lavishly dressed.  
 Elston called
 his physiotherapist  
 Fred. Then  
 Fred said  
 "Take two  
 times five  
 gerbils, attach  
 three scintillating  
 disco balls  
 which were  
 hanging on  
 his ears,  
 " not that  
 there's anything  
 quite as   
 succulent as  
 Peking Duck  
 noiselessly gliding  
 through a  
 greasy broth  
 and call   
 your mama!  
 On Tuesday,  
 his mama   
 baked cake.  
 Unfortunately, her  
 favorite cook-book  
 , poorly proofed,  
 said "boil"  
 instead of  
 "stir", so  
 , sadly, the  
 elephant cried.  
 It was     
 nighttime when  
 we drove   
 home from  
 the planet  
 for some   
 unknown reason  
 , and I    
 couldn't see  
 who came   
 to scare   
 the raccoons  
 that ate   
 my toes.   
 The elephant  
 trumpeted his  
 french horn  
 ,which caused  
 pandemonium throughout  
 the Senate.  
 Meanwhile, back  
 and front  
 grew daisies  
 , and these  
 kept pushing  
 and pushing  
 until the  
 the elephant  
 popped out  
 a big      
 bag of     
 in-the-shell peanuts!  
 "I'm allergic!",  
 squeaked Elston's  
 rubber ducky.  
 Love-a-Duck swam  
 up Love-canal  
 &lt;beep!&gt; rule violation -- disregard the previous entry.

away from  
 the swirling  
 drain. Fearlessly  
 blood from  
 (I'm lost)  
 anyone sucking  
 the ineffable  
 tube of    
 incredibly tasty  
 , low carb  
 yorkshire pudding  
 product, then  
 it should  
 not burst  
 in ear.    
 Consequently, the  
 lawyers have  
 jointly concluded  
 that illegal  
 distribution of  
 hairpins to  
 members of  
 the opposition  
 , is highly  
 likely to  
 cause undue  
 pain in    
 the abdominal  
 region of  
 anyone who  
 dares approach  
 and looks  
 through the  
 hairpin bin.  
 Of course,  
 the hairs  
 on her     
 face were  
 intricately woven  
 and decorated  
 with green  
 four-leaved clover  
 and suspiciously  
 devoid of  
 the usual  
 shit. Why  
 the hell   
 she chose  
 his kind   
 doberman to  
 defend the  
 dastardly King's  
 stash of   
 dark chocolate  
 , instead of  
 giant lizards  
 that could  
 shoot lasers  
 blinding the  
 chasing enemy  
 and slicing  
 cucumbers thinly  
 lengthwise. From  
 the north  
 of Spain   
 to the     
 top of     
 spaghetti, there  
 arose a    
 marvelous beast  
 of chocolate.  
 Insofar as  
 the monkey  
 was concerned,  
 who pose   
 no threat  
 to the     
 elephant population,  
 present scant  
 evidence indicates  
 the existence  
 of extremely  
 large gerbils,  
 with enormous  
 scat, smelling  
 the roses  
 near the   
 unbelievably exotic  
 pommes frites.  
 Our hero   
 began to   
 feel that  
 ,in Iberia,  
 the pizzas  
 were lacking  
 enough whypslovens.  
 Myrmidons, however,  
 were in    
 cahoots with  
 double agents  
 spying on  
 the gerbils
 are coming,  
 with all   
 preposterous buffoons  
 and fanfare  
 . With the  
 ornate yet
 green coloured  
 domed arches  
 splendidly adorned  
 with Hohos.  
 That reminded  
 the giraffe  
 to duck    
 when entering  
 the nebulous  
 feeling of  
 bas-reliefs under  
 a velvet   
 Elvis painting.  
 The giraffe  
 deeply enough  
 so big     
 seductively licked  
 my ear,    
 to cause   
 an infection.  
 The red    
 hickey on  
 my ear     
 elicited comments  
 like: "What  
 bit you?   
 The reply  
 , delivered emphatically,  
 consisted of  
 "burla blahh"  
 , because I  
 was too    
 tired to   
 spit out   
 the pineapple  
 awkwardly obstacling  
 my tongue.  
 Everyone knows  
 green apples  
 served with  
 maple dressing  
 and custard.  
 But few    
 have heard  
 of fried   
 olives with  
 chocolate topping  
 and anchovies  
 that cure  
 the whitlow.  
 Suddeny, aardvarks  
 actually activated  
 by solenoids  
 and adenoids  
 inflamed, swollen  
 beyond reasonable  
 doubt. For  
 eternity, apricots  
 have conspired  
 to obfuscate  
 and disinform  
 the masses  
 of curly   
 lettuce in  
 the midst  
 of summer  
 festivals honoring  
 the mighty  
 farmers who  
 danced divinely  
 in syncopation.  
 Fireworks added  
 a fascinating  
 background to  
 the celebration.  
 The screams  
 of little  
 squirels, hunted  
 by a       
 badger who  
 just wanted  
 to be      
 their friend,  
 made the   
 masses scream  
 for more.  
 However, realizing  
 this, the  
 badger promptly  
 left his   
 elephant on  
 the boil   
 that he    
 wore proudly  
 on his     
 left flank.  
 One day,   
 the elephant  
 sat on     
 the badger's  
 bananana daiquiri  
 making squishing  
 sounds and  
 splashing around  
 shattering the  
 silence with  
 orgiastic sounds.  
 Then the   
 bartender fainted,  
 the fencer  
 feinted, and  
 riposted like  
 a rattlesnake  
 while simultaneously  
 juggling slimy  
 snails with  
 of intrepid  
 myrmidons attired  
 indiscreetly.  "My  
 goodness," said  
 Elston, "I  
 have no    
 friends to  
 rebuff such  
 preposterous and  
 yet strangely  
 intriguing creatures."  
 However, earlier  
 Elston had  
 a problem.  
 The problem  
 perplexed poor  
 church mice  
 too; it    
 even befuddled  
 rich dragons  
 and modern  
 Millie (thoughly).  
 Suddenly understanding  
 his predicament,  
 Elston phoned  
 his lawyer.  
 , Snidely Sharkskin,  
 who immediately  
 took a     
 wise descision  
 to drink   
 a large    
 quantity of  
 pangalactic gargle  
 blasters, which  
 when consumed,  
 turned everything  
 wildly hallucinogenic.  
 Even mushrooms  
 and aardvarks  
 were nothing  
 compared to  
 phantom spectres  
 ghoulishly green  
 and purple,  
 whirling dizzily  
 through millenia  
 of legal   
 loopholes. In  
 every tree  
 there crowed  
 Numidian Ravens,  
 their noses  
 ,full of   
 chocolate cream,  
 and jellied  
 eels.  Bananas  
 were involved  
 in a       
 particularly nasty  
 case of    
 monkey business  
 ! Elston leapt
 , as only  
 elephants can  
 ,unfortunately, landing  
 headlong on  
 Charles Dickens  
 , who demanded  
 an apology.  
 However, Elston  
 didn't respond  
 in the     
 usual manner;  
 but only   
 snortled and  
 blew a     
 seal. Oh,  
 one mustn't  
 expect everyone  
 that finds  
 a new      
 copyright-free work  
 to squeal  
 with delight.  
 Some unfortunate  
 people had  
 stumbled into  
 the secret  
 cupboard which  
 had been   
 darkly camouflaged  
 and well   
 -made by   
 hunderds of  
 carpenter ants  
 from Amish  
 homesteads.  Once  
 they saw   
 my pants,  
 which were  
 the most   
 densely spattered  
 and deeply  
 stained garment  
 that ever  
 was seen   
 , or so    
 it seemed  
 to seven   
 inquisitive mice,  
 who happened  
 along at   
 the opportune  
 moment.  Returning  
 from his   
 mountain climb,  
 Elston's father  
 , who was  
 as kind    
 as a       
 little fluffy  
 blood-sucking  
 mosquito. The  
 Jedi knight,  
 whose father  
 caught rare  
 hamburgers in  
 midair, swung  
 his axe    
 perilously close  
 to Elston's  
 left ear   
 . His earring  
 , encrusted with  
 peppercorns, barnacles,  
 cranberries and  
 those tiny  
 shrimp that  
 are tasteless,  
 except to  
 the old    
 shark who  
 was looking  
 rather ill  
 , flew across  
 Elston's family,  
 displaying remarkable  
 pictures of  
 his favorite  
 trip to    
 Guatemala.  Almost  
 in time,   
 a squirrel  
 darted across  
 the airport,  
 landing heavily  
 , her suitcase  
 filled with  
 clarinet reeds.  
 "Oh!" exclaimed  
 my sister,  
 pointing at  
 the slimy  
 yet strangely  
 enticing fungus,  
 she wanted  
 sauted with  
 wild onions,  
 and slightly  
 mouldy,  green  
 leafy vegetables.  
 Alas! It   
 took more  
 than fine  
 motor skills  
 to catch   
 the herring  
 which was  
 once alive  
 but now    
 a zombie   
 scampering along,  
 whistling "The  
 Little Yellow  
 Flute", which  
 is commonly  
 considered to  
 enrage small  
 birds. Despite  
 several attempts  
 by the     
 police force,  
 which was  
 not known  
 to have    
 a large    
 presence in  
 Elston's neighborhood  
 it was     
 generally known  
 amongst jugglers  
 that gravity  
 rarely reverses  
 without serious  
 hilarity for  
 everybody concerned  
 especially with  
 no trousers  
 . "I love  
 this giant  
 peach," Elston's  
 friend Roald  
 whispered quietly...  
 But is     
 it necessary  
 to scream  
 for ice    
 cream and  
 anchovies? Perhaps  
 not, yet   
 the chimpanzee  
 hates bananas  
 in others'  
 beer.  With  
 great enthausiasm  
 for urban  
 renewal, Elston  
 rented a   
 rhinestone-studded  
 nose-ring  
 big enough  
 for himself  
 and two    
 members of  
 the neighbouring  
 family of  
 wild squirrels  
 to live.   
 "With luck,  
 we'll eat  
 a stray    
 Distributed Proofreader  
 unmindful of  
 the chewy  
 Proofreading Guidelines  
 regarding naked  
 spellchecking and  
 volleyball. We  
 being clueless,  
 about the  
 oldest profession  
 continued our  
 game of    
 gerbil croquet.  
 Squealing, he  
 ran to     
 the end    
 of time    
 where he   
 stopped to  
 plan his   
 next proofraiding  
 binge. As  
 a member   
 of Citizens  
 Against Unlawful  
 Markup Use  
 , Elston went  
 undercover, sneaking  
 quietly towards  
 the vulnerable  
 underside of  
 the Jabberwock  
 as though  
 he was     
 about to   
 tickle his  
 toes. But  
 no! His    
 pink trunk  
 with legs  
 as long    
 as mine    
 on a       
 3" scale.  
 was validated  
 by comparing  
 gobbledegook with  
 data gathered  
 from Zoroastrianism.  
 So, today  
 something peculiar  
 appeared in  
 Elston's soup.  
 Seven peanuts  
 from Mars  
 danced gaily  
 across the  
 field covered  
 in purple  
 , green and  
 yellow tights  
 and a      
 black silk  
 strapless dress.  
 Scientists could  
 begin to   
 reach for  
 their strangely  
 attractive labcoats  
 before they  
 found that  
 strange smell  
 emanating from  
 the nearby  
 jar of     
 Pooh's hunny  
 with the   
 smackral of  
 nice, creamy  
 chocolate frosting  
 quietly smouldering  
 without anyone  
 noticing. Meanwhile,  
 insanity was  
 brewing in  
 the castle  
 , what with  
 the incredibly  
 short notice  
 to redesign  
 the privy  
 . Two seats  
 a grain    
 ,filled with  
 daffodils and  
 crocuses, provided  
 curious counterpoint  
 to my      
 turreted bungalow.  
 That was   
 not the    
 best way   
 the most   
 to decorate  
 highly valued  
 hovercraft that  
 hovered like  
 hummingbirds sucking  
 rancid butter  
 , but it   
 looked surprisingly  
 unlike a   
 lemming. On  
 his way    
 he jumped  
 like a     
 baby tortoise  
 over a     
 of golden  
 pollen that  
 stuck to   
 his crutches  
 ,which posed  
 a conundrum  
 most bewildering  
 : How can  
 a monkey   
 dance so   
 spontaneously with  
 no gloves?  
 He flung   
 the boomerang  
 behind him  
 and grabbed  
 the handy  
 handbook provided  
 . "Don't Panic"  
 , as it    
 is all     
 under control  
 by toothless  
 hordes of  
 witches, who  
 will never  
 again bother  
 to check   
 their hats.  
 The headwaiters  
 and janitors  
 jointly decided  
 to stage   
 an impromptu  
 coup d'etat  
 removing the  
 only hindrance  
 to their   
 hat check.  
 Only if    
 spiny anteaters  
 could dance  
 like Elston  
 on fire    
 ! FIRE! FIRE!
 Bring buckets!
 and spades!  
 in spades!  
 fly again.  
 When the   
 minute hand  
 of my      
 fell off,  
 grandfather's clock  
 huge thunderstorms  
 ,together with  
 very realistic  
 and eager  
 beavers armed  
 with oversized  
 slingshots, raced  
 hungrily towards  
 oversized sausages  
 with large  
 umbrellas attached.  
 Meanwhile, in  
 another haystack  
 soggy little  
 mice munched  
 peanuts that  
 were worth  
 , well... peanuts.  
 Charlie Brown  
 didn't think  
 Elston ought  
 to wear    
 lederhosen with  
 high heels  
 , even if  
 Bertie Wooster  
 bought them  
 cheaply from  
 eBay, where  
 he'd sold  
 his favorite  
 pair of    
 plus-fours which  
 Rowan Atkinson  
 suprisingly ate.  
 Bean belched  
 loudly and  
 fragrantly, while  
 attempting to  
 proof tables  
 in Latex.  
 without success  
 because yralih  
 's girls woofed  
 and bit    
 in pantomime  
 all the    
 escaped inmates  
 Oh no      
 ,Elston exclaimed  
 with horror.  
 "Where's my  
 towel?" "Don't  
 reply that!!"  
 yelled the  
 spiders.  "It  
 might go   
 pear-shaped  
 ." Then, suddenly,  
 from nowhere,  
 a beautiful,  
 blue butterfly  
 with green  
 sunglasses and  
 pink flowery  
 stockings, flew  
 out of     
 the insides  
 of a       
 pink spotted  
 stuffed cheetah.  
 Not surprisingly,  
 everything we  
 nullify everytime  
 ends up    
 writhing in  
 blissful joy  
 and enlightening  
 the crickets.  
 Once Elston
 found his  
 red pyjamas  
 trying to  
 assimilate the  
 wild turkeys  
 into his   
 sock drawer,  
 he decided  
 nothing was  
 sacred anymore,  
 and baked  
 two dozen  
 Chocolate Chunk  
 filled sponges,  
 simultaneously trying  
 to stir    
 marshmallows into  
 his soup.  
 Conversely, the  
 ancient scrolls  
 , reprinted post-1923,  
 and JulietS  
 were discovered  
 heading for  
 the flaming  
 kitchen fires  
 ,slowly devouring  
 every single  
 banana in  
 Elston's pantry
 JulietS cried, "  
 Hurray! The  
 proofers who  
 lost their  
 sight and  
 dress sense  
 have finally  
 invested in  
 ear trumpets!"  
 Obviously, this  
 was not
 what DP-Guidelines  
 said. But  
 the proofers  
 had interpreted  
 "Diacricital Marks"  
 as only    
 some guys  
 writing scurrilously  
 , "I'm Mark."  
 Nevertheless, Mark  
 soon realized  
 every keystroke  
 counted twice.  
 After seven  
 swans swam  
 , singing silently,  
 sideways under  
 starlight, they  
 attentively started  
 sewing superb  
 stuffed shirts,  
 with buttons  
 sparkling sporadically  
 and shimmering  
 like billy-o.  
 The missing  
 mysteriously beautifull  
 molybdenum magnets  
 turned up  
 curiously in  
 the proofer's  
 outbox, never  
 causing any  
 undue irritation  
 to the     
 overworked mentor  
 who suggested  
 that this  
 was unusual.  
 Without any  
 warning, the  
 cherry-picker  
 clicked six-hundred-ninety-two  
 keys on    
 black friday  
 and escaped.  
 The angry  
 army ants  
 attacked the  
 alarmingly agile  
 coding squirel  
 who donned  
 domed hoods.  
 While this  
 unforeseen event  
 posed certain  
 logistical difficulties,  
 smooth waters  
 soon prevailed.  
 A great    
 , legendary proofreader  
 without coat  
 or broadband  
 connection suggested,  
 that they  
 might enjoy  
 an apertif  
 before disrobing--  
 ...and so they did.

 A sad      
 DP volunteer  
 was cheered  
 up by      
 dancing on  
 the purple  
 elephants back.  
 "Yes! Oh,  
 oh yes!   
 OH YESSSSSSSS!!!!!!!    
 and yet...  
 I'm lost,"  
 he sighed.  
 And promptly  
 took his   
 pink umbrella  
 with the   
 furry handle  
 outside for
 a long  
 walk in    
 the rain.  
 Meanwhile, the  
 fifteen gerbils  
 tried not  
 ok so crucify me already. i got carried way.  
 to tread   
 on crosses  
 . Neither did  
 the snakes  
 deem it    
 completely necessary  
 to avoid   
 the appearance  
 of being   
 a complete  
 bunch of   
 steamed asparagus.  
 So Elston  
 , being pompous  
 (a word    
 he always  
 enjoyed demonstrating),  
 bought a   
 round-trip ticket  
 to Timbuktu  
 aboard the  
 dirigible, Akron.  
 Sadly, it  
 was time  
 , not space,  
 was Elston's  
 tune for   
 moments when  
 the pigeons  
 insisted on  
 flying eastwards  
 despite the  
 new guidelines.  
 Meanwhile, in  
 a distant  
 land where  
 no frightening  
 mice ever  
 wander into  
 alternate dimensions,  
 Elston's second  
 -cousin Eloise  
 was listening  
 secretly behind  
 a vine-covered  
 wrought-iron trellis,  
 and overheard  
 an eerie   
 whispering voice,  
 suggesting someone  
 was watching  
 the young  
 squirrels that  
 cavorted merrily  
 near the   
 quaking aspen  
 overlooking the  
 canyon that  
 abruptly fell  
 very far   
 downward into  
 the darkness.  
 "Oh, dear!",  
 she cried,  
 "I simply  
 don't understand  
 how the    
 space monkeys  
 can write  
 such imaginative  
 instructions for  
 connecting to  
 dancing elephants  
 on toe     
 of frog!"  
 Having calmed  
 his Grandma  
 by judiciously  
 applying cold  
 water on   
 her delicate  
 yet firm   
 large aubergines  
 , which despite  
 Grandpa's repeated  
 attempts to  
 divest her  
 of her     
 fruits, he  
 labored over  
 the mental  
 problems involving  
 promoting eager  
 newbies to  
 unreservedly accept  
 beanies with  
 their feedback.  
 " A Beanie!!",  
 cried one  
 eager newby  
 ecstatic newbie.  
 "I always  
 Grandma snarled,  
 "hated gerbils,  
 "too chewy",  
 "don't you"  
 "dare serve"  
 gerbil stew  
 to Aunt    
 Sally!" Elston  
 shivered in  
 delight, for  
 gerbil stew  
 never appealed  
 to anyone  
 but gerbils.  
 "Bring me  
 my porridge  
 to paste   
 your hide!."  
 Intead, Elston  
 nibbled on  
 some crunchy  
 dried mackerel.  
 This satisfied  
 his initial  
 cravings, but  
 left him   
 slurping all  
 the pilsner  
 until he   
 remembered that  
 better beer  
 is often   
 the best   
 shaken, not  
 nearly burst.  
 was rudely  
 and debased  
 by non-sequiturs.  
 Finally, the  
 gurglings of  
 many non-sequiturs  
 burst forth  
 from the   
 magical fountain.  
 Thoroughly sick  
 and fearing  
 for his    
 old life   
 to undo    
 the damage  
 heaped upon  
 the kitchen  
 by exploding  
 the oven   
 right after  
 the cake   
 sagged, Elston  
 ran to     
 the slaughterhouse  
 to die.    
 But when   
 Louise read  
 the instructions  
 she toppled  
 the ungainly  
 wooden statue  
 , preventing it  
 carrying his  
 lumpy elephant  
 to the     
 beautiful garden  
 overflowing with  
 lumpy elephants.  
 It is      
 a marvel   
 that these  
 kind of    
 proofers could  
 rise above  
 petty differences  
 to unify   
 themselves. Hooray!  
 The triumph  
 of overcoming  
 all those  
 space monkeys  
 was just   
 a surprizing  
 twist in   
 an already  
 exciting story.  
 "Alas," said  
 the lion   
 , smacking his  
 large lips  
 wistfully. "If  
 those gazelles  
 would only  
 slow down,  
 bring barbeque-sauce,  
 and pepper  
 while I    
 prepare the  
 barbecue pit  
 for the    
 guests who  
 come for   
 tea and    
 tasty crumpets  
 but never  
 bring flowers,  
 despite their  
 mothers' reminders,  
 I could    
 almost taste  
 my mother's  
 afternoon tea  
 and fishcakes!"  
 Elston contemplated  
 a party    
 and invite  
 d the entire  
 Distributed Proofreaders  
 crowd to   
 wear silly  
 hats only!  
 No spoons  
 were needed  
 when the   
 DPers ate  
 the Turkish  
 Delight which  
 tasted of  
 flavored honey  
 and almonds.  
 Later, when  
 the polkas  
 were scheduled  
 to finish,  
 it transpired  
 that the   
 bandleader decided  
 not to     
 wear any   
 lederhosen. The  
 shocked celloist  
 refused to  
 go home.   
 The police  
 were surprisingly  
 happy to   
 let the    
 protesting environmentalists  
 dance like  
 delerious fireflies  
 until several  
 broke down  
 and had    
 whiplash injuries  
 in pain    
 like fire.  
 they dash  
 --they slither--  
 to shelter  
 beneath any  
 skirt that  
 lay on     
 warm heads.  
 Just before  
 anybody thought  
 that things  
 had gone   
 awry, Constance  
 quickly stepped  
 behind the  
 concrete pillar  
 that stood  
 in front   
 of Prudence's  
 boudoir mirror.  
 Everyone wondered  
 what next?  
 Eighteen years  
 of slow    
 accumulating guilt  
 finally forced  
 out of     
 him the    
 following admission:  
 "Yes, I    
 am the     
 one who    
 ate your   
 chocolate coated  
 cherry. But  
 our alligator  
 was snapping  
 so playfully  
 at our     
 goldfish that  
 I had      
 neglected to  
 put back   
 the smallest  
 of covers  
 from the   
 fish tank  
 this morning.  
 thus Tuesday  
 spelt doom  
 upon entire  
 generations of  
 his family  
 who were   
 eating chocolate  
 but who    
 carelessly put  
 the chocolate  
 in the     
 paper shredder.  
 "What a    
 shame!" said  
 Elston, (remember  
 he is      
 just this  
 one helpful  
 elephant) decided  
 changes aren't  
 always desirable,  
 only inevitable.  
 Poor Elston  
 thought hard  
 for days   
 , eating tons  
 of fresh   
 plantains and  
 marmite sandwiches,  
 with side-orders  
 of glazed  
 ham and    
 and yams.  
 Then revelation  
 presented itself  
 to Elston  
 like a     
 sock in    
 the face:  
 he didn't  
 belong in  
 such an    
 august group  
 , instead he  
 decided to  
 join Y.E.F.P-C.!




(the Young Elephants in Favor of Peanut-Coladas, of course)  
 This mind-altering  
 business gave  
 a new      
 perspective to  
 the evolving  
 process of  
 baking chocolate  
 with help  
 from gnomes  
 fresh out  
 of school  
 . Henceforth, Elston  
 made sure  
 that his   
 wellingtons were  
 always on  
 and polished  
 whenever he  
 went dancing.  
 Elston's dance  
 instructor privately  
 taught him  
 always to  
 hold the   
 right hand  
 in whypslovens.  
 Even so,   
 the monkeys  
 gathered ominously  
 talk over  
 new strategies  
 re elephants  
 and whypslovens.  
 On the     
 next occasion  
 for dancing  
 we rocked  
 hard to    
 Yanni and  
 God knows  
 what else.  
 Then Elston  
 stretched his  
 trunk out  
 and grabbed  
 a passing  
 albatross, which  
 promptly threw  
 the fish   
 to the     
 undercover policeman.  
 I once     
 thought that  
 police officers  
 would be   
 my friends.  
 However, when  
 they started  
 to tell    
 the press  
 about Elston's  
 secret life  
 and loves,  
 it became  
 too difficult  
 for him    
 so they're  
 calling in  
 for take-out  
 of some    
 ice cream!  
 It's delivered  
 by seagulls  
 wearing purple  
 tatted antimacassars  
 on their   
 family's favourite  
 1951 chevy  
 with leather  
 and new    
 steel wheels  
 instead of  
 marshmallows. Sadly,  
 without marshmallows,  
 there was  
 little hope  
 of pudding.  
 that nite  
 as Elston  
 Elston who?  
 danced through  
 the gnarled  
 fence post  
 pallisade, singing  
 , "I'm an  
 octupus you  
 can't see  
 , in an    
 empty cave  
 filled with  
 a surprising  
 sparkling light!"  
 Naturally, this  
 was not    
 quite what  
 the songwriter  
 had originally  
 considered, but  
 she knew   
 it wouldn't  
 discombobulate the  
 ever demanding  
 singers of  
 postmodern pop  
 . During spring-break  
 Elston continued  
 his quest  
 for peanuts  
 to eat     
 while pillaging  
 the pirate  
 ship, which  
 was headed  
 towards southern  
 climes, redolent  
 of fish    
 and fishy  
 smelling pirates.  
 Our hero   
 quickly discovered  
 hundreds of  
 big, hairy  
 elephants in  
 frilly ballgowns  
 hiding in  
 the Captain's  
 closet. It  
 was certainly  
 disastrous that  
 the bumblebee  
 sat on     
 the captain's  
 whypslovens causing  
 a rain     
 of pollen  
 to fall    
 cut roses  
 in the     
 Cap'n's Tea.  
 Nevertheless, too  
 much work  
 and no     
 appropriate reward  
 for the    
 worst work  
 of art     
 , makes Elston  
 a dull     
 maroon wombat.  
 But why    
 ?" he cried,  
 when seeing  
 the enormous  
 pink flippers  
 that the   
 Traffic Warden  
 insisted on  
 jailing instantly  
 in Timbuktu.  
 Death was  
 lurking sprightly  
 amongst the  
 maroon wombats  
 which surfaced  
 suddenly as  
 teatime approached.  
 The third  
 act of     
 shakespeare read
 very strangely  
 by the     
 light of   
 the alabaster  
 which came  
 unwillingly through  
 unexpectedly available  
 portals of  
 mysteriously swirling  
 milk. Speeding  
 along the  
 information superhighway  
 to the     
 House of   
 Mild Surprise,  
 then the   
 shivering Elston  
 found his  
 groove again.  
 Finally, Elston  
 exuberantly snorted  
 up the     
 scattered pollen  
 he'd ingested.  
 Now that   
 led to     
 an unexpected  
 postnasal drip  
 with a     
 ghastly yellow  
 sulpher smelling  
 emission and  
 left the   
 pitiful pachyderm  
 slumbering peacefully  
 .  If only  
 Vermicious Knids  
 knew how   
 to do      
 the hornpipe.  
 Elston brandished  
 his sabre  
 most valiantly  
 but alas   
 his trunk  
 rather obscured  
 his footwork,  
 when he    
 lunged towards  
 the pirate.  
 "You dastardly  
 , fiendish, piratical  
 elephant!" he  
 then went  
 further to  
 accuse Elston  
 of breaking  
 into showbiz  
 which elicited  
 this response:  
 "All I     
 wanna do   
 sing for   
 my supper,  
 and dance."  
 "Perfect," said  
 the ringmaster  
 enthusiastically. "You  
 are just   
 the least  
 likely person  
 on my      
 dance card  
 to interest  
 an emu."   
 A crow     
 was murdered  
 while cawing  
 some instructions  
 to Marvin  
 in Japanese.  
 But haiku  
 resists interpretation  
 especially under  
 the influence  
 of pudding  
 , unless it  
 is especially  
 well written.  
 Well-written pudding  
 , however, is  
 the most   
 delightful surprise  
 on earth.  
 Off earth,  
 well-written pudding  
 tends to   
 be a       
 sticky subject  
 leading to  
 unrestrained consumption  
 of hot     
 green tea.  
 Mr Tea     
 wondered what  
 could possibly  
 happen next  
 with greentea  
 when, inconveniently,  
 he was     
 possessed by  
 a yowling  
 winged cat  
 purring wildly  
 like a     
 fox.  Elston  
 hoped desperately  
 that he    
 would find  
 the legendary  
 Father Merrin  
 when he    
 searched through  
 his great-aunt  
 Jolene's estate  
 expecting not  
 to find    
 any peanuts.  
 Mr Tea     
 then noticed  
 that greentea  
 seemed more  
 refreshing than  
 she had    
 intended. This  
 led to     
 a most     
 surprising discovery:  
 chocolate is  
 the most   
 widely used  
 after hot  
 orange marmalade  
 on toasted  
 raisin bread  
 but marmite  
 tastes better  
 than axle-grease.  
 Scientists everywhere  
 report that  
 opened the  
 red cardoor  
 revealing a  
 lonely little  
 gerbil with  
 a pointed  
 silly hat.  
 "You must  
 never ask  
 for a      
 kiss, unless  
 you intend  
 to return  
 to the     
 bargaining table  
 with another  
 bottle of  
 india ink.  
 ".  Thus saith  
 Wellington Bunn.  
 This Halloween  
 Wellington went  
 to a       
 (n) undisclosed location  
 to buy     
 treats for  
 all proofreaders  
 who wore   
 big green  
 wet suits  
 under their  
 pirate regalia.  
 It seems   
 slightly insane  
 for Elston  
 , because usually  
 frog tea   
 is served  
 chilled with  
 mint and   
 lots of    
 sugar. Dollars  
 to donuts,  
 to show    
 Elston how  
 it happened  
 to come    
 about that  
 horse diseases  
 captivated us.  
 On the     
 flipside, Elston's  
 dancing classes  
 , taught by  
 Polka Champion  
 Squinty Kahestellenbelcher,  
 Kentucky Derby  
 winner Giacomo,  
 and Georgie  
 , the Curious,  
 got cancelled.  
 This was   
 his lawyer's  
 Bad Idea   
 .  Big Bill  
 A.K.A. "Wild  
 *censored*" was  
 aghast, and  
 quickly froze  
 some fresh  
 lederhosen for  
 his newest  
 invention, "Slacks  
 for Snowmen."  
 This annoyed  
 Elston, so  
 he bit     
 evil satu's  
 newly purchased  
 squeeky toy  
 in half,   
 thereby causing  
 the release  
 of the     
 doomsday device

(Muahaha, &amp;c.)  
 thereby finally  
 emitting some  
 magnetic monopoles  
 that destroyed  
 only hamsters  
 that yawn  
 when they  
 sing. Elston  
 felt dreadfully  
 embarrassed by  
 the appearance  
 of large   
 crimson growths  
 on his     
 unusually large  
 sandwich of  
 marmite, bananas,  
 and chocolate.  
 The next   
 time the   
 postman slipped  
 three pounds  
 of candied  
 fruit into  
 his pocket  
 , Elston thanked  
 the Academy  
 that had   
 never let  
 any mice   
 without shoes  
 running havoc  
 in the     
 pants. More  
 sweet candy  
 was prescribed  
 in high    
 atmospheres. Flowers  
 growing above  
 the grass  
 showed their  
 alluring beauty  
 when they  
 opened, revealing  
 ancient mysteries  
 of dark    
 unknown origin.  
 Elston, noticing  
 one flower  
 that glowed  
 with immense  
 beauty lured  
 brilliantly iridescent  
 flowers that  
 flowers that  
 appeared twice  
 every night  
 last week.  
 On Tuesday,  
 our cow    
 decided that  
 dairy products  
 were not   
 suitable for  
 young humans.  
 Old proofers  
 set standards  
 for dairy  
 farmers, by  
 arguing strongly  
 that "while  
 dairy farming  
 may be     
 fun, it    
 is still   
 a pain     
 in the     
 neck, or   
 so people  
 not accustomed  
 5am milkings  
 would say  
 ." It is   
 hard to    
 milk a     
 bull, as   
 poor Elston  
 discovered when  
 he tried   
 . Tomorrow he  
 will consider  
 the giraffe  
 -looking beast  
 with wings  
 , although he  
 fears that  
 the wombat  
 will not   
 help him   
 find his   
 new thing  
 deep under  
 the piles  
 of immensely  
 fluffy kookaburras.  
 Tomorrow Elston  
 will be    
 tickled pink  
 when he    
 forgets to  
 tie his    
 tie with   
 yellow ribbon  
 around his  
 old oak    
 dining table.  
 Elston's tie  
 would have  
 frightened any  
 right minded  
 person, because  
 of the     
 blood stains  
 on its     
 end, which  
 were real.  
 and the    
 evidence reveals  
 he was     
 not the    
 only one   
 wearing whypslovens  
 , a rucksack,  
 pink shorts,  
 and bell-bottoms  
 with lacy  
 underwear showing  
 with exceptional  
 scurrility. His  
 infantile behavior  
 concerning candies  
 caused a   
 diabetic reaction  
 when he    
 scoffed 18-lbs.  
 of caramel.  
 The next   
 day he     
 was discharged  
 out of     
 a cannon.  
 As elephants  
 don't fly  
 extremely well,  
 Elston had  
 only moments  
 of clarity  
 before he  
 fell heavily  
 in love    
 with the   
 flying saucer  
 that he    
 saw last   
 hovering under  
 his umbrella.  
 The beach  
 was down   
 *-town, east  
 of the     
 memorial statue  
 representing cheese  
 and crackers.  
 This statue  
 attracted the  
 very same  
 tame pigeons  
 that Gertrude  
 kept in    
 her open   
 Weber barbeque  
 , which caused  
 quite a    
 kerfuffle in  
 Donald Trump's  
 Christmas stocking:  
 redolent with  
 the scent  
 of freshly  
 leftover from  
 yesterday's lunch.  
 Roses are  
 not recommended  
 for youngsters  
 in their   
 pajamas, because  
 they might  
 use them   
 to fend    
 off the    
 thorny problems  
 of matrimonial  
 timetables, while  
 repeatedly ironing  
 the petals  
 that fall  
 daintily upon  
 lower left  
 being full,  
 corners of  
 Twister mats.  
 "Ohhh, lovely  
 idea, but  
 where are  
 the chocolate  
 sprinkled little  
 cookies? "Under  
 the bed,   
 safely packed  
 in marmite.  
 Elston screamed  
 "No, not   
 there! They'll  
 mutate into  
 marshmallow zombies!!"  
 The moon   
 marshmallow-like and  
 menorah shaped  
 , caused Elston  
 to ponder  
 the deep   
 meaning of  
 asparagus, and  
 a brilliant  
 soufflé of  
 anchovies and  
 black olives.  
 Ironically, this  
 was exactly  
 what Elston  
 had been   
 craving since  
 Elstina ran  
 with the   
 bulls in   
 Pamplona and  
 beat them  
 roundly while  
 local elves  
 frustratedly examined  
 the interociter.  
 It was     
 hard to    
 but nonetheless  
 the elves  
 persevered in  
 spreading jelly  
 everywhere except  
 on Santa's  
 nose, which  
 had grown  
 to a(n)    
 most unexpected  
 texture resembling  
 coarse sandpaper.  
 "Ho ho     
 No!" he    
 ululated, rubbing  
 , frantically wishing  
 a genie    
 would help  
 him to     
 extricate his  
 red jeans.  
 This done(,)  
 Elston's wish  
 to become  
 the only   
 male elephant  
 to ever    
 grace the  
 cover of   
 Popular Mechanics.  
 His trip   
 to the     
 farthest reaches  
 of the     
 Indexian Continent  
 left him   
 dancing with  
 the banana  
 , and cheer  
 for DP!!!!  
 Horray! A  
 new method  
 for filleting  
 badly formatted  
 elephant dances  
 which led  
 to increased  
 productivity in  
 certain quarters.  
 Meanwhile, in  
 other news,  
 wild squirrels  
 buried walnuts  
 along the  
 left side  
 of our     
 driveway. When  
 the King   
 rashly called  
 Bartholemew Cuthbert  
 an elephant.  
 , Elston wailed  
 "But I'm   
 . "Oh No!"  
 Stumbling over  
 his words  
 because he  
 was, in    
 fact, slightly  
 tipsier than  
 forseen after  
 New Year's  
 peanutcoladas. Fortunately  
 , management had  
 not distributed  
 extra rum  
 along with  
 the noisemakers  
 , so it    
 became clear  
 that the   
 exciting events  
 about to   
 overwhelm the  
 indicted general  
 were not   
 quite enough  
 to demonstrate  
 his obvious  
 saltatorial inability.  
 Meanwhile, Elston  
 daydreamed of  
 a lady     
 elephant who  
 could drink  
 a hectolitre  
 of dandelion  
 juice. Sadly  
 a hectolitre  
 is too     
 difficult to  
 measure. So  
 Elston turned  
 to more    
 enchanting pursuits  
 (because shaving  
 his earlobes  
 without any  
 peanut butter  
 was difficult)  
 such as    
 proofing a  
 novel written  
 in Fraktur  
 which goes  
 Frick Frack  
 for pleasure.  
 Elston next  
 forayed into  
 snowwy forrests  
 filled with  
 lemon peel  
 , lemon merengue  
 and eggshells  
 left by    
 gigantic bluish  
 tortoises which  
 frightened Elston  
 into running  
 behind the  
 nearest yurt  
 and applying  
 hot compresses  
 upside his  
 left ear.  
 But then   
 Elston's mother  
 reached out  
 her trunk  
 packed full  
 of delicious  
 crunchy ferrets  
 in plum    
 sauce and  
 cream cheese.  
 Advanced diplomacy  
 suggested that  
 pineapples would  
 go nicely  
 inside her  
 grandmother's petit-fours  
 instead of  
 those ferrets,  
 whose shiny  
 viking hats  
 got in     
 the way    
 of the     
 mailman. In  
 Elston's refrigerator  
 beneath a  
 hibernating frog  
 , a lonely  
 lumberjack wished  
 he had     
 remembered to  
 wear suspenders  
 , rather than  
 the old-fashioned  
 garter belt  
 his mother  
 knitted, which  
 chaffed his  
 freshly waxed  
 knoddlehopper. Having  
 never learned  
 precisely what  
 his favorite  
 word meant,  
 Elston bravely  
 pretended to  
 polish his  
 whypslovens while  
 searching for  
 his secret  
 stash of   
 dictionaries and  
 bubble-up which  
 is hidden  
 under mom's  
 left arm   
 , wrapped in  
 celophan (sp.?). During  
 the night  
 the fairies  
 brought brand-new  
 overly-hyphenated lug-nuts  
 (which are  
 hidden in  
 socks belonging  
 to gnomes)  
 who wear   
 socks, surprisingly  
 ferret sized  
 which itched  
 of double-posting
 . Having lost  
 sight of   
 the left-hand  
 and the    
 beloved other  
 left wife  
 , Elston wondered  
 leftily deftly  
 where this  
 story goes.  
 Now that   
 three mongooses [**could it be mongeese?]  
 were mongoosing  
 quietly along  
 when the   
 mayor's daughter  
 was goosed  
 , the mayor  
 then admonished  
 the mongooses'  
 parents, "You  
 filthy ****cencored***  
 "Oh! Pardon  
 me," interrupted  
 Marjorie, the  
 lonely lumberjack.  
 "The mongoose  
 were thrilled  
 to find    
 that their  
 shrubbery had  
 spontaneously combusted.  
 "Goodness gracious  
 said the   
 gardener, "I've  
 lost my    
 marbles. Where  
 can they   
 be. Now    
 I'm sure   
 I didn't   
 squirrel them  
 away, as   
 I usually  
 try to     
 because walnuts  
 are notoriously  
 difficult to  
 crack after  
 the dentist  
 polishes them.  
 Polishes what?  
 Polishes when?  
 Immediately after  
 having found  
 polishing wax  
 up the     
 lonely lumberjack's  
 kangaroo pouch  
 , Elston put  
 his pet    
 Felicity) into  
 the bathtub  
 together with  
 a rubber   
 duckie, of  
 which Elston  
 was very   
 fond. Giving  
 a ladybug  
 a flower   
 is weird.  
 It doesn't  
 signify the  
 most precious  
 allegorical masterminded  
 book, but  
 it does  
 bake tasty  
 chocolate cakes.  
 In retrospect,  
 Elston wished  
 that bathtubs  
 came with  
 rubber duckies,  
 that talk!  
 Then he    
 borrowed my  
 talking duckies  
 which went  
 sponges, urchins
 and all,   
 down the   
 drain. Crying  
 , throwing his  
 teeth down  
 , and bellowing  
 "I can't   
 go on      
 dancing all  
 year!" he  
 wailed as  
 loudly as  
 frying eggs  
 on a       
 hot engine.  
 An enticing  
 idea came  
 uregently, pressing  
 him back   
 to happier  
 days. Fortunately,  
 he could   
 quote "Python"  
 in French;  
 this led   
 almost inevitably  
 to the     
 adoption of  
 new ways   
 , opposed by  
 Elston's distant  
 relative, Fred  
 Flintstone, who  
 yelled: "Pebbles",  
 and Bam-Bam  
 ran looking  
 for Dino.  
 Dino and   
 Brad Pitt  
 , potential co-stars  
 in a       
 musical called  
 Dancing Pachyderms  
 , shuffled off  
 , waving their  
 canes and  
 cavorting like  
 elephants. Meanwhile,  
 back at    
 the ranch  
 twenty-seven flamingos  
 were dancing  
 , costumed as  
 pirates and  
 lonely lumberjacks  
 showing off  
 their enormous  
 distlefinks and  
 while chopping  
 broccoli.  Once  
 the end    
 is near    
 , things begin  
 to become  
 abundantly clear...  
 that elephants  
 can forget  
 whatever they  
 choose, and  
 their choice  
 : the hokey-pokey.  
 "The hokey-pokey  
 is the     
 next craze  
 on board   
 at the     
 University of  
 Distributed Progress.  
 Lately, my  
 hokey-pokey skills  
 have grown  
 rusty. Fortunately  
 lessons are  
 available at  
 Yurts-R-Us, where  
 champion yodelers  
 yodel daily  
 , scaring the  
 mice and   
 elating the  
 older men.  
 The mauve  
 some part  
 oopsadoodle, singing  
 Norwegian Wood  
 accompanied by  
 an accordion  
 bemused the  
 inhabitants of  
 the enchanted  
 garden of  
 the octopuses.  
 Noices, in  
 of the     
 swimming pool  
 , attracted Elston's  
 attention. He  
 hurriedly gathered  
 rosebuds while  
 Dancing Banana  
 relaxed nearby.  
 [Also relaxing  
 his guard  
 , the penguin  
 stealthily crept  
 slowly, backwards  
 colliding clumsily  
 with Elston's  
 backup dancers.  
 Elston looks  
 surprised, but  
 not totally  
 amazed.] The  
 crux of    
 this story  
 depends on  
 the willingness  
 to suspend  
 your imagination  
 from the   
 everyday world.  
 Almost magically,  
 be transformed  
 by the     
 unexpected flavor  
 of chocolate-covered  
 chocolate bars  
 with fudge  
 and chocolate  
 sprinkles. It  
 all began  
 to taste   
 rather like  
 chocolate, much  
 more so    
 than real  
 sweeter though  
 .  Underneath the  
 label it   
 said clearly  
 BEWARE IF  
 you open   
 the wrong  
 end first!  
 Doing so   
 will cause  
 great trepidation  
 and trembling  
 of limbs   
 . Eslton enjoyed  
 this trembling  
 ; it reminded  
 him of     
 cherry Jell-O  
 causing his  
 dancing feet  
 to wiggle  
 as they    
 jiggled and  
 jostled through  
 frantic tourists  
 who tried  
 to move    
 past them  
 unpolitely. Canadian  
 officials stated  
 that Quebec  
 was again  
 no longer  
 interested in  
 dancing elephants  
 , banning smoking  
 while tangoing  
 to the     
 mini-bar.  
 shaking every  
 hand extended  
 toward him  
 despite knowing  
 no one.    
 The penguin  
 thought "Aha!",  
 and intoned  
 "Carpe diem!"  
 and kissed  
 the bride  
 and tossed  
 the horseradish  
 over his   
 left shoulder.  
 It landed  
 between two  
 well known  
 mimes who  
 immediately fell  
 into despair.  
 Gesturing urgently,  
 the priest  
 ushered the  
 trembling congregation  
 under the  
 altar-cloth, hoping  
 the mimes  
 despair had  
 caused no  
 invisible obstacles  
 to exude   
 clues to   
 their vampiric  
 toward all  
 mortal beings.  
 Now, immortal  
 doing immoral  
 filching of  
 parakeets that  
 protested loudly  
 the taxation  
 of their   
 birdseed supply  
 and surcharges!  
 Jimmy Cagney  
 rises up   
 once again  
 from the   
 ashes of   
 yesterday's barbecue  
 to pursue  
 the rampant  
 brisket, sauce,  
 grilled corn-on-the-cob,  
 while dancing  
 off the    
 port bow.  
 The gerbils  
 , tasty little  
 found a    
 discontinuity in  
 the sentence  
 . Who proofed  
 that one? ;)  
 Elston didn't!  
 It was     
 evil Gluefoot!
 Aha! cried  
 Elston wisely.  
 "I knew  
 it was     
 not one    
 of my      
 closest friends!"  
 Hercule Poirot  
 started investigating  
 the disappearance  
 of the     
 nefarious Gluefoot  
 the banana-dancer.  
 Pink Panther  
 , his dance  
 instructor, and  
 partner in  
 bridge, was  
 trumped by  
 Donald Trump  
 ironically, when  
 he played  
 his trombone.  
 But tinnitus  
 distracted him  
 from recollecting  
 his wife.  
 The shoppingmall  
 musak supervisor  
 worked over-time  
 to find    
 Yanni playing  
 cards with  
 Kenny G,   
 Ricky Nelson,  
 and Prince.  
 They were  
 in the     
 alley behind  
 the bowling  
 green watching  
 rats eat   
 leftovers from  
 yesterday's grand  
 slam at    
 the Denny's  
 across the  
 alley.  BANG!  
 Back on    
 track! now  
 just when  
 least expected:  
 the Spanish  
 (Unexpected) Inquisition  
 marched    
 happily in  
 ,wearing boas  
 and pythons  
 around their  
 ugly necks.  
 Yelling, "Gulty!  
 Guilty, away  
 with them!"  
 So away    
 they went  
 across the  
 golden desert  
 searching for  
 the oasis  
 with the   
 date palms  
 that sway  
 and wobble  
 rythmically with  
 occasional little  
 tilts and  
 ripples.  There  
 quite unbelievably  
 stood Elvis  
 accompanied by  
 the entire  
 Mormon Tabernacle  
 Accordion Band.  
 Softly humming  
 "Raspberry Beret,"  
 and wiggling  
 his bank   
 , Elston tried  
 to appear  
 unconcern while  
 the little  
 imaginative trolls  
 living under  
 the bridge  
 and playing  
 bacci balls  
 with iridescent  
 flowers, showed  
 off their  
 immaculate preceptions  
 of rhythmic  
 gymnastics.  Fortunately,  
 Elston left  
 just in    
 time to
 see his    
 bungee-jumping grandmother  
 rebound and  
 sway perilously  
 as she     
 dangled over  
 jagged cliffs  
 shouting loud:  
 LONG LIVE  
 EASY CHEESE!  
 The cheese  
 was affronted  
 by grandmother's  
 allusion, but  
 didn't make  
 any attempt  
 to explain  
 how it     
 heared those  
 preposterous words!!?!!  
 Tomorrow Elston  
 eats cheese  
 with peas  
 and honey  
 baked in   
 termite mounds  
 .  For dessert  
 , as usual,  
 strawberry jello  
 found in   
 big buckets  
 with lots  
 of special  
 secret codes  
 disgustingly juvenile  
 in character,  
 and causing  
 no end     
 of giggling  
 to the     
 jiggling of  
 the dessert.  
 Much later,  
 deep in    
 the swamps  
 of Arizona,  
 an onyx    
 chess-set miraculously  
 floated above  
 the murky  
 mists that  
 were formerly  
 part of    
 the lost   
 Empire of  
 Martha Stewart  
 the Magnificent.  
 The pieces  
 of eight   
 that the   
 evil pirates  
 stole from  
 Elston were  
 discovered underneath  
 Gluefoot's secret  
 peeling chamber  
 among the  
 piles of   
 shattered remnants  
 remaining after  
 the collapse  
 of his     
 Jellybean Dynasty.  
 It is      
 a little-known  
 fact that  
 canaries and  
 little green  
 beetles can  
 joyfully knit  
 an entire  
 blanket in  
 over two   
 decades without  
 consternation. Suddenly  
 Elston sat  
 up, aghast  
 at the     
 big, green  
 blob advancing  
 towards him  
 through the  
 tulgey wood  
 , whiffling as  
 it oozed   
 over his   
 Grandmother's credenza!  
 It screamed  
 like a     
 frightened child  
 who's just  
 realized how  
 large the  
 Easter Bunny's  
 teeth are.  
 Next, the  
 Blob ate   
 chocolate eggs
 and whipped  
 butter with  
 cinamon-raisin bagels  
 .  Elston then  
 knew that  
 antacids alone  
 wouldn't be  
 enough to  
 make the   
 birds in   
 the garden  
 burst into  
 tears, unless  
 placated with  
 blob eggs.  
 Scrambled eggs  
 on cinnamon-raisin  
 toast with  
 butterscotch pudding  
 and green  
 cheese on  
 a bagel    
 made from  
 god knows  
 what appeared  
 inedible. Softly  
 the Blob   
 hummed "Tiptoe  
 softly, my  
 sweet aspen,  
 goto sleep."  
 Edsger Dijkstra  
 , the famous  
 ballerina of  
 little skill,  
 told his   
 tragic tale  
 , tears teeming  
 , nose running  
 and hankie  
 falling down  
 from his   
 rhinestone tiara  
 , while executing  
 a difficult  
 demi-pliés in  
 the bathtub.  
 Elston sobs  
 were heard  
 by the     
 rhinestone diggers  
 standing just  
 outside the  
 rotunda in  
 the snowy  
 chateau de  
 Tar Pit.   
 More romantically  
 situated than  
 the Swamps  
 of Desperation,  
 the Plains  
 of Pity,   
 and the    
 Not Very   
 Tall Mountains  
 of hope    
 , it had   
 definitely acquired  
 a sense    
 of the     
 surreal, and  
 looked intreguing.  
 LOOK!  The  
 dancing elephant  
 shrieked with  
 joyful anticipation  
 as he      
 waltzed around  
 with his   
 svelte partner,  
 Frederika, who  
 haughtily raised  
 her trunk  
 and removed  
 her fake   
 tusks.  WHAT?  
 Fake? No!  
 But how    
 could she  
 remove them  
 if they    
 weren't falsies?  
 Titillating, indeed,  
 but the    
 evidence proves  
 beyond doubt  
 that smoke  
 -colored glass  
 is highly  
 susceptible to  
 thermal fracture  
 at equatorial  
 temperatures. So,  
 with a     
 hop, skip,  
 you may    
 just as    
 well try   
 saltatorial exercises  
 before bedtime  
 as well.   
 Returning to  
 Elston and  
 his mostly  
 outdated antics,  
 we find    
 dancing mice  
 in the     
 cheese pantry  
 doing the  
 can-can.  Elston's  
 grandmother, Elvira,  
 loves mice  
 and cheese  
 especially on  
 toast for  
 toast with  
 vegemite! Sadly,  
 vegemite supplies  
 no good
 cholesterol, although  
 we love    
 the taste  
 on omelettes.  
 Everything always  
 tastes better  
 in springtime,  
 despite vegemite's  
 natural tendancy  
 to degrade  
 in the     
 compost pile  
 when adjacent  
 to the     
 worms of   
 Aristophanes.  When  
 frogs appear  
 one should  
 cautiously embrace  
 one's irreplaceable  
 metaphors, but  
 watch for  
 low flying  
 kingfishers. They  
 are fishing  
 for kings,  
 although my  
 instinct says  
 they really  
 aren't going  
 to give    
 anyone a   
 fluffy boa  
 soon. Afterwards,  
 when the   
 batteries had  
 spontaneously combusted,  
 the airplane  
 stalled. Gliding  
 like a     
 surreptitiously advancing  
 armada of  
 Spanish fly,  
 Elston ducked  
 but it     
 hit his    
 upper left  
 tusk and   
 crashes loudly  
 . Elston yelped  
 in pain,   
 and danced  
 a frantic  
 tango of   
 the bewildered  
 lumberjack. Sighing,  
 he began   
 to pick    
 his trunk  
 lock and   
 hoped that  
 he jumped  
 before another  
 into it    
 plot twist  
 arose to   
 confuse the  
 poor elephant.  
 Socrates' ghost  
 came around  
 for tea,   
 , however, confusing  
 teacups for  
 finger bowls,  
 he started  
 a philosophical  
 debate about  
 Charles Darnay's  
 oral hygiene.  
 The end    
 of their   
 debate brought  
 feelings of  
 sadness because  
 the hemlock  
 smoothie had  
 run out.   
 Where did  
 the floating  
 pink cloud  
 alight? Rarely  
 had Elston  
 seen such  
 fine specimens  
 , surely not  
 since last  
 summer, when  
 the moon   
 was waxing  
 the floor  
 with marmalade  
 cats wearing  
 pirate hats.  
 The cats   
 were enjoying  
 some sun   
 and napping  
 blissfully, until  
 the world  
 inexplicably shifted  
 further toward  
 an ice-age.  
 "Burrrrrrrr", said  
 Elston, "I  
 never thought  
 my whypslovens  
 would stop  
 sneezing! What  
 a relief!"  
 Meandering over  
 his problems  
 and quietly  
 studying the  
 dust specks  
 that covered  
 his large  
 overstuffed sofa  
 , Eston tried  
 the vacuum  
 cleaner first.  
 It exploded,  
 as happens,  
 when everything  
 is cosmically  
 FUBAR.  Elston
 ,dust-covered and  
 grumpy, resolved  
 to smite   
 the mites  
 with spite.  
 They didn't  
 yet bite,  
 kick, or   
 fight, though  
 they might  
 demand rights  
 and alight  
 in sight   
 at night   
 on white   
 bread quite  
 all right.  
 Confused, Elston  
 waltzed across  
 Texas with 
 his mother.  
 The striped  
 armadillos that  
 masqueraded as  
 Russian military  
 had secretly  
 planted five  
 Planter's Peanuts  
 in the     
 parsnip patch  
 without bothering  
 to inform  
 their mothers.  
 Their mothers  
 , thus uninformed,  
 cheerfully cooked  
 creamed carrots  
 and parsnips  
 (creamed carsnips??)  
 , with peanuts  
 on toast.

 Every Thursday,  
 music swells  
 from the   
 mandolin orchestra  
 and all    
 the frogs  
 say "Aristophanes"!  
 Following that  
 blatent lie  
 we call    
 our optimum  
 chocolate consumption  
 levels without  
 a qualm    
 we eat     
 oranges, pears,  
 plums, cherries,  
 and chocolate.  
 Chocolate always  
 makes people  
 want more  
 than they  
 can kill   
 , especially wild  
 plants. Tomorrow,  
 Elston resolved,  
 to start   
 running more  
 than six   
 miles a-day  
 weighed down  
 with chocolate  
 so heavy   
 that it
 caused him  
 to over-balance  
 squashing chocolate  
 cream-puffs and  
 generally causing  
 mayhem, destruction  
 and unhappiness.  
 Soon, however,  
 joyful giggling  
 erupted throughout  
 the yurt   
 , as people  
 wiggled into  
silken fabric,  
 mounds of  
 cleverly disguised  
 as chocolate  
Silk worms  
 .  The now  
 chocolate covered  
 giggling Elston
 had to
scarper, avoiding  
Chocoholic pirates!

 The pirates  
 made a     
 slight error  
 and threw  
 the distelfink  
out of  
 a porthole.  
 Hell hath  
 no fury    
 such as    
 a pirate   
 with their  
 distelfink gone!  
 Where was  
 the elusive  
 pirate, he  
or she  
 was called  
to attention  
 pending the  
 investigation into  
Chocoholics Anonymous  
 and its    
 financial schemes  
to bankrupt  
 our nutritional  
 values. Fortunately,  
 the plot   
 failed, but  
Distelfink swim!  
 or swam,   
right over  
 the place  
 , ducking around  
the dam  
 flying over  
 the Humvee--  
alien saucers,  
 lonely lumberjacks,  
 and into   
 the treetops,  
 mashing dadly  
 beyond Mansion  
 Hill Flats.  
 The monkey  
faced Martian  
 and throws  
 an egg     
 laid by    
 Bethlehem Steel  
 (ouch!!--steel  
 eggs!!).  The  
 egg flys   
 over every  
 head present,  
 presently heading  
 toward the  
 head of    
 downtown headquarters  
 for eggs.  
 Unusually long-lived,  
egghead agents  
 with long  
memories and  
 short pants.  
 "GO !!!!  Eggplants!!!!"
 was their  
clarion call  
 to go      
 into battle  
 with parmesan  
 cheese on  
 toast, with  
 asparagus spears,  
 and carrot-cake.

 Being pacifists,  
 club sandwiches  
 rarely bite  
 culinary experts!  
 However, Batdog  
 flew over  
the Ballcat  
 , exclaiming "What  
 kind of    
 story is   
 this without  
 mind-altering drugs  
? DP heaven!  
 So, Gluefoot  
 went forth  
 with his   
 evil buddies  
into 'Batland'  
 , carousing like  
 drunken pirates  
on grog,  
 brandishing cutlasses  
 and Pontiacs  
 supercharged with  
fermented bat-droppings,  
 which didn't  
half pong!  
 Wandering aimlessly,  
 elephants, turtles,  
 and all    
that jazz  
 were lost  
 on the     
 windswept plains  
 until Elston  
rescued them,  
 having recovered  
on waking  
 to discover  
 his trunk  
 has turned  
 grey. What  
a shock!  
 Pondering the  
 possible ramifications  
of metamorphosis,  
 a mouse    
 built a    
 better cat-trap  
 to great   
 applause. The  
 whole point  
 is to      
be 'top-dog'  
 of catland.  
 Quietly offering  
 kazoo music  
 , Elston slipped  
the instrument  
 under his  
 left ear   
 , leaving space  
 for his    
 sheet music  
 beside his  
 trombone.  Music  
 is one     
 his favorite  
pleasures, others  
 being chess,  
 and cards.  
 Poker-playing elephants  
hide emotions,  
 because they  
 invariably have  
 good hands  
, large fortunes,  
 and excellent  
chess skills  
 . Yosemite Sam  
 , Elston's formidable  
 compadre and  
poker rival  
 in spades,  
 started a  
 reality show  
 assessing proofing  
 ability during  
 guideline updates  
, first prize  
 being a    
shiny-new robot  
 that proof-reads.  
 Elston's audition  
 for Shakespeare's  
 King Lear  
 didn't go  
 to Broadway  
, later ones  
were successful.  
 DON'T LOOK  
 at the     
 twinkling stars  
 when hit   
 by lightning  
 because the  
 flashes could  
 make you   
 jump all   
 around, but  
Elston's girlfriend  
 knew how   
 deceptive those  
 could be.  
 She would  
 have liked  
 faster action  
-man dolls  
 , elephant shaped  
 like herself.  
 Posing, Elston  
 saw the    
 photographer's little  
 ploy to    
 make him   
 a fashion-model  
 with huge  
 temper tantrums  
, putting pressure  
 his girlfriend's  
(Elsa's ?) situation  
 . The twelve  
 little elephants  
 with red   
 tassles on  
 their tails  
 danced like  
 drunken lumberjacks  
 along the  
 sidewalk, twirling  
 in dizzying  
procession, oblivious  
 to the     
 sober men  
 who followed  
menacingly behind,  
 them.  One  
 by one     
 , they raised  
their trunks  
 and trumpeted  
sober-men fell  
 into drunken  
 war-stories, glad  
 of the     
 new sound  
 trumpeting through  
 the din.   
 "I've got  
 the whole  
 enchilada," declared  
 the old    
 toreador, "despite  
 everything you've  
 suspected! I'll  
 never go   
 near a     
 bullfight again!"  
 Flinging his  
 cape over  
 his shoulder  
 belligerently he  
 stalked off  
 into the   
 deepest tundra.  
 Large snow-bunnies  
 frolicked merrily  
 along the  
 sidewalks, and  
 found they  
 could bounce  
 snowballs  without  
 breaking them  
 . Summertime was  
 no fun     
 except for  
 all the    
 terpsichorean interludes  
 , singing sleestaks,  
 dictionary salesmen,  
 etc. However,  
 steadfastly ignoring  
 safety issues  
 Elston chose  
 to dance   
 on the     
 merry-go-round at  
 Potomac Park  
 Round and  
 round he   
 went; nausea  
 compelled him  
 to stop    
 maniacally beside  
 the puce   
 car. He    
 rested for  
 5 minutes  
 and began  
 yet another  
 dance on   
 roller skates  
 this time  
 following his  
 trail map  
 of breadcrumbs  
 mendicant friars  
 ; some nasty  
 set traps  
 for butterflies  
 and elephants  
 outside the  
 Pope's balcony  
 .  A trap  
 , sumptuously embellished  
 with real  
 peanuts and  
 elephant icons  
 carved from  
 chocolate and
 ivory-coloured meringue  
 , served on  
 buttered toast  
 points. Because  
 Harvey wanted  
 to see     
 if pink-elephants  
 camouflage themselves  
 using local  
 vegetation, he  
 looked under  
 the willow  
 for his    
 pair of    
 handcuffs, disturbing  
 two fieldmice  
 which scolded  
 him loudly.  
 Startled, Elston  
 retreated behind  
 the begonias  
 draped along  
 the fence.  
 Peering furtively  
 over the   
 fence at   
 the shocked  
 papal delegation's  
 private swimming-pool  
 lifeguard, scantily  
 clad in    
 a tiny
 yellow polka-dot  
 chasuble, trimmed  
 with ermine  
 (unquestionably synthetic)  
 and lace   
 booties.  Embarassed  
 , Elston sprang  
 off the    
 diving board  
 , drenching all  
 of the     
 in extreme  
 cold beer  
 over ProjectManagers  
 squealing delightedly  
 as they    
 pruned begonias  
 with chopsticks  
 and pitchforks.  
 Pink-Elephants shouldn't  
 take umbrage  
 when their  
 umbrellas fail  
 to open    
 underwater, except  
 situations where  
 marauding koalas  
 grenades. Fortunately,  
 Elston likes  
 marzipan, which  
 provides opportunities  
 when they  
 open a     
 savings account  
 at Harbor-Bank  
 of Antarctica.  
 Marzipan goes  
 around and  
 around like  
 rumours about  
 tiny babies  
 heads when  
 big people  
 squash them.  
 Another marzipan  
 delight, bulging  
 from pockets  
 stuffed with  
 extruded brains  
 and tomatoes  
 mixed with  
 , showed his  
 flexibility with  
 juggling clubs  
 and flaming  
 cheap seats  
 , although culinarily  
 inept. "Drat,  
 " said Glue-Foot,  
 "my evil  
 squirrel has  
 tresspassed the  
 boundaries of  
 common decency  
 and shaken  
 the very   
 foundation of  
 our society.  
 "No matter,"  
 yelled Glue-foot  
 excitedly, "I  
 have yet   
 created a  
 double for  
 myself, and  
 half for   
 some marzipan.  
 " Nobody could  
 have imagined  
 what I     
 would surely  
 do for     
 some marzipan!  
 It was     
 a cigar    
 hanging limply  
 and remotely,  
 in her     
 office, but  
 fortunately it  
 didn't smell."  
 My kite    
 was tangled  
 in seaweed  
 , which hung  
 low and    
 high from  
 the branches  
 of coral   
 on the     
 surreal hillside.  
 Seventeen imaginary  
 green unicorns  
 untangled their  
 squirrel-like paws  
 from my    
 long blond  
 tresses, leaving  
 me free    
 to tat     
 and tale   
 of misdemeanors  
 with tablecloths.  
 A jonquil-colored  
 telegram, crocheted  
 with tiny  
 chocolate marzipan  
 oozing with  
 delectable yet  
 calorie-riddled sentiments  
 and carefully  
 delivered by  
 a distelfink.  
 arrived today  
 along with  
 two boxes  
 of books   
 badly chosen  
 for their  
 pristine spines  
 and colorful  
 misinterpretations resulted  
 at the     
 in amusing  
 but profoundly  
 scholastic ways  
 of discoursing  
 on the     
 disturbing habits  
 marzipan squirrels  
 display under  
 stress.  With  
 both feet  
 firmly planted  
 in marzipan,  
 altough most  
 Meanwhile back  
 assuredly not  
 going barefoot,  
 Elston tried  
 to juggle  
 jiggling jello  
 and wobbling  
 Weebles, but  
 failed misserably.  
 Fumbling with  
 Jello can  
 be messy   
 and slightly  
 addictive, but  
 a cheap    
 high. Jell-O-holics  
 running bewildered  
 after tasting  
 bitter sweet  
 chocolate shavings  
 and marzipan  
 , tried to  
 get in     
 the factory  
 furtively, making  
 wrong turns  
 left and   
 ended up   
 sprawled beneath  
 a shadow.  
 Looking up,  
 high up,   
 into the   
 soaring hammerbeam  
 I discovered  
 below me   
 is unseen.  
 old ranch  
 dressing factory,  
 Elston's suit  
 of worsted  
 magenta-colored wool  
 loosely but  
 elegantly draped  
 his body   
 making him  
 less portly-looking  
 and more   
 delicate, like  
 flowers in  
 early spring  
 , tra la   
 and tally  
 ho! The    
 suit was   
 perfectly matching  
 to his     
 polka-dotted socks  
 and girlfriend's  
 fashionably skimpy  
 howdah. Together  
 they marched  
 merrily, munching  
 marzipan in  
 caramel toffee.  
 By chance,  
 a delicious  
 red rosebud  
 attracted a  
 lost bumblebee
 whose sense  
 of fashion  
 was acquired  
 in prison  
 fashion school  
 years ahead  
 of schedule.  
 The bee    
 stung Elston  
 on his     
 girlfriend's orders  
 ill-mannered and  
 angry from  
 having marzipan  
 -covered shoes  
 stepping on  
 her new    
 rose bushes.  
 Meanwhile, underneath  
 the ol'-oak  
 tree, squirrels  
 munched acorns  
 , apricots and  
 maple seeds
 which helps  
 pachyderms exfoliate  
 , which isn't  
 commonly known.  
 Henry screamed  
 and Elston  
 fainted, causing  
 mass hysteria  
 amongst the  
 nearby cheerleaders  
 which is
 not surprising,  
 considering how  
 panic usually  
 begins and  
 spreads throughout  
 the population  
 within a   
 region like  
 Epsom salts  
 dissolves in  
 an instant  
 and produces  
 delicious tasting  
 , crispy toast  
 and marmalade.  
 Making Grilled-Cheese  
 and marmalade  
 crepes is  
 difficult, unless  
 it is      
 Christmas, when  
 the elves  
 make them  
 with jewelled  
 George-Forman grills  
 powered by  
 marmalade and  
 Hyundai. The  
 confused elves  
 didn't expect  
 a direct   
 hit to     
 American automotive  
 aesthetics after  
 winning the  
 award for  
 puff pastry.  
 Profiteroles notwithstanding,  
 Elston decided  
 to go      
 home in    
 a Bentley.  
 A rare     
 red wolf   
 spied a    
 trio of    
 spotted owls  
 marinating in  
 clarified marzipan  
 . The owls  
 also were  
 complaining bitterly  
 to the     
 squirrels, who  
 offered to  
 their fake  
 household gods  
 a peanut.  
 Why are    
 marinated peanuts  
 the preferred  
 suicide implement  
 for marzipan  
 junkies? Because  
 they provide  
 an apocalyptic  
 legumic vision  
 for vegemite  
 and worms  
 and shortlived  
 poets. Historically  
 such marzipan  
 being yellow  
 , is mistaken  
 for a      
 spread made  
 by drunk   
 lumberjacks who  
 swam without  
 waiting twenty  
 minutes after  
 midnight.  Coffee  
 might induce  
 paranoia in  
 French towns  
 separated from  
 Paris by   
 night. Surely  
 a chupacabra  
 wouldn't be  
 amiss, thought  
 Marmaduke's caretaker  
 while being  
 assaulted by  
 several bears  
 slipped dangerously  
 between nondescript  
 and highly  
 bordered fences.  
 Thankfully, the  
 fluffy paw  
 of a       
 friendly wombat  
 hindered by  
 two sticks  
 tried to   
 interpose itself  
 between decaying  
 lime Jello  
 and greenish  
 remnants of  
 yesterday's salad.  
 Tomorrow the  
 sun will   
 probably publish  
 a retraction  
 , ruefully recanting  
 its trip   
 while insinuating  
 it wasn't  
 functionally illiterate,  
 that it    
 needed to  
 front-line.  Eggplant  
 rarely hatches  
 in bright  
 April moonlight  
 without a  
 gorilla sitting  
 nor waving  
 a portrait  
 of King    
 Henry VIII  
 conducting lxxvi  
 dismembered members  
 heads off  
 permanently. Obviously  
 this caused  
 much consternation  
 for the    
 boys in    
 the hood   
 , trombones primed  
 seventy-six boys  
 , ten girls  
 ,three goats  
 and a      
 Heffalump, searching  
 for edible  
 truffles, got  
 annoyed while  
 spelunking.  However,  
 truffle snuffling  
 and whuffling  
 can lead   
 ineffably to  
 a ripe     
 truffle, even  
 without a  
 farnarkling rulebook  
 or dictionary.  
 Heffalumps usually  
 finds the  
 summer too  
 hot and    
 muggy for  
 tiptoeing through  
 undergrowth of  
 bright orange  
 daylilies and  
 lima beans.  
 Elston decided  
 he shouldn't  
 fret nor   
 think that
 was just   
 cause or   
 act according  
 to legend  
 when he    
 thrashed the  
 pumpkin police  
 ball by    
 spitting sharp  
 nails into  
 their jello-filled  
 but smelly  
 dishes.  Then  
 , quite suddenly,  
 inappropriately attired  
 dancing elephants  
 wearing corduroy  
 miniskirts and  
 tassled gumboots  
 , sequinned surcingles  
 , copper bangles  
 which never  
 jingle jangled  
 at all.    
 Tusks ostentatiously  
 decorated by  
 tiny marsupials,  
 wilting lettuce,  
 and adorable  
 little multi-colored  
 nematodes, that  
 curled cutely  
 around his  
 waistband which  
 had a      
 cute buckle.  
 After loosening  
 his muscles  
 by rubbing  
 the right  
 tusk on    
 several convenient  
 fire hydrants,  
 Elston began  
 a hula.    
 Conveniently, fish  
 already know  
 how to     
 negotiate sharp  
 corners, and  
 schools. Next  
 day is     
 Friday and  
 Elston will  
 have a     
 wee-little beer  
 because it  
 satisfies deep  
 down in    
 his rumbling  
 tummy the  
 niggling sensation  
 makes him  
 seek the   
 path to    
 Oblivia where  
 rumbling tummies  
 made happy.
 Happy maybe,  
 but how    
 much happier  
 without those  
 marzipan pills  
 they'd be!  
 WHAT!?!  It  
 could only  
 mean one   
 had to     
 do the     
 hokey-pokey and  
 , turn around  
 , carefully avoiding  
 getting dizzy  
 and falling-down.  
 Outside, spiritual  
 tree-hugging activities  
 led by     
 Guru Swami  
 and hundreds  
 of cobras  
 all cuddly  
 and playful,  
 caused a   
 trance-like state  
 among squirrels  
 who watched  
 with cameras.  
 Eating ice-cream  
 with hazelnuts  
 caused the  
 squirrels to  
 search for  
 hot cups   
 and marzipan.  
 Then they  
 comforted orphan  
 ostriches, ominously  
 like leeches  
 they spell  
 and hex    
 wrenches. "Stop  
 wrenching my  
 hazelnuts!" shrieked  
 Alice Cooper,  
 wondering whether  
 chewing cobras  
 would benefit  
 his career.  
 MMMMMmmmm, fresh  
 mouse mousse  
 , phyllo filled  
 ferrets, and  
 rodent roulade  
 dressed with  
 caribou coulis.  
 Done eating,  
 Elston sought  
 to contact  
 the mothership  
 carefully concealing  
 his plan   
 to abduct  
 Gluefoot and  
 Alice Cooper  
 without his  
 knowledge. Meanwhile,  
 fake marzipan  
 Gluefoot look-alikes  
 are invading  
 heated soft  
 salty pretzels.  
 "Dunk 'em,  
 fair dinkum,  
 delay not!"  
 cried Captain  
 Kangaroo, "Cover-em  
 and stash  
 'em, but   
 don't forget  
 to chill   
 the champagne!"  
 "Behold, Captain,"  
 breathed Elston  
 heavily, "we  
 should have  
 Chocolate Delight  
 when the   
 squirrels finish  
 the ironing."  
 Do squirrels  
 care if    
 ironing boards  
 make excellent  
 housewives, while  
 dancing with  
 chipmunks? Probably  
 their preoccupation  
 creates chaotic  
 patterns of  
 little kittens,  
 leaving their  
 grandmothers puzzled  
 by hairballs.  
 Dancing bananas
 , inspired by  
 tasteless, yet  
 mesmeric, artwork  
 , gyrated wildly  
 , giggled wickedly  
 , and grinned  
 ominously. "Zounds!"  
 swore the  
 under-represented plantains  
 "Take cover,  
 they are   
 yellow and  
 yet strangely  
 fragrant. But  
 beware! All  
 that glitters  
 can deceive  
 restless souls  
 with shine.  
 I have     
 fixed some  
 appliances with  
 duct-tape to  
 increase the  
 likelihood of  
 constructive or  
 proper repair.  
 Elston, unable  
 to fly     
 over the   
 Alps decides  
 to inspect  
 his belly-button.  
 Without lint  
 his magic  
 ballet slippers  
 melted away  
 like pavlova  
 and her    
 scruffy dogs.  
 Elston's aunt  
 got in     
 trouble when  
 the tangelo  
 she threw  
 hit a      
 rock and   
 out sprang  
 five tiny  
 little reindeer.  
 Pavlova sugar-highs  
 interfere with  
 one's mental  
 state, but  
 they shouldn't  
 detract from  
 the very   
 delicate balance  
 maintained between  
 cannibalism and  
 devout Vegetarian.  
 Or they    
 deliberately aim  
 chocolate soufflés  
 at the     
 heads of   
 blissfully unaware  
 cabbages. Afterwards,  
 cutting up  
 the veggies  
 blisful thoughts  
 with a(n)  
 thoughtful knife.  
 Use the    
 serrated edge  
 to achieve  
 from scratch  
 a delectable  
 assortment of  
 lovely, petite  
 proofers who  
 can proof  
 while patting  
 down suspects  
 Only CReating  
 chocolate marzipan
 surounded by  
 DP adicts  
 who like   
 to fantasize  
 about perfect  
 pages. Everyone  
 loves me   
 even though  
 I have     
 not been   
 chosen as  
 chief marzipan-taster  
 or undersecretary  
 of chocolate  
 for squirrel  
 affairs. In  
 real life  
 nobody cares  
 if they    
 have affairs  
 with chocolate  
 or marzipan  
 confections, which  
 leave traces  
 chocolate marzipan.  
 of nuts    
 just like  
 the baklava  
 that we    
 love to    
 hate. Without  
 knowing why  
 , Elston's mother  
 went to    
 the nearest  
 fire exit  
 where smoke  
 wafted delicately  
 up the     
 by the     
 filigree canopy  
 . Suddenly, she  
 raised her  
 right hind  
 leg, as    
 smoke irritated  
 the smaller  
 inhabitants of  
 blistering, hot  
 toasted marshmellow  
 shaped planets  
 that flew  
 merrily around  
 her son    
 like hummingbirds.  
 Starting down  
 the garden  
 fertilizer aisle  
 in search  
 of something  
 to help    
 eliminate chronic  
 backaches, Elston  
 danced dispiritedly  
 on shovels,  
 between rows  
 of tents   
 where the  
 elves and  
 antelopes play  
 cricket. The  
 eleven elephants  
 watching from  
 flag poles  
 also danced  
 , periodically falling  
 on trampolines  
 , their trunks  
 flailing like  
 pink flamingoes  
 on amphetamines.  
 Morning, Mr.  
 Elston snorted  
 a cricketer  
 wearing baggy  
 underwear over  
 his bat.   
 Elston responded  
 in kind    
 and offered  
 peanut-butter toast  
 to the     
 assembled multitude,  
 distributing crumbs  
 to assorted  
 impersonators of  
 DP Squirrels.  
 The umpire  
 who happened  
 to enjoy   
 eating at  
 county fairs  
 dressed in  
 his tent   
 , parachute pants,  
 and tartan.  
 Big feathers  
 fluttered gracefully  
 around the  
 home of    
 the Byrds,  
 while wild  
 goose bumps  
 in bright  
 speckled the  
 elephants' skin,  
 already decorated  
 bold stripes  
 to ensure  
 effective camouflage  
 as a       
 fat inmate.  
 Elston was  
 always eating.  
 "Marzipan, an'  
 fluffernutter sandwiches  
 in his     
 lunchbox," said  
 Gluefoot disparagingly  
 while wiping  
 glue all   
 over Elston's  
 pet mice   
 thus preventing  
 them from  
 making cheese  
 scones and  
 chocolate marzipan.  
 However this  
 also kept  
 them busy  
 helping Gluefoot  
 detach himself  
 psychologically from  
 all material  
 not glued  
 down. This  
 gave Rosalind  
 time to    
 watch passing  
 bananas hop  
 , laughing, into  
 the streetcar.  
 "Desire calls  
 those that  
 remember the  
 Alamo and  
 marzipan bananas.  
 Desire also  
 twists." Pretzels  
 are desireable  
 , especially when  
 very salty."  
 After contemplating  
 nutrition requirements  
 , Elston's mother  
 started to  
 take notes  
 and coins  
 from the   
 tip jar    
 , hoping that  
 Elston wouldn't  
 see her.   
 guilty look  
 and inform  
 the Infomagicians  
 . She didn't.  
 Elston wondered  
 where the  
 coins went?  
 Who could  
 tell me.   
 Go ASK     
 Jeeves! He'll  
 know.  We  
 all should  
 donate our  
 fishing rods  
 , hip waders,  
 and sunglasses  
 while there's  
 still time  
 , to the   
 Pachyderm Emancipation  
 League. Twenty  
 eighty-one, North  
 South-West  
 Boulevard was  
 awash with  
 Ninja gerbils  
 fiercely battling  
 Jedi hamsters  
 in the     
 foyer, while  
 the sidewalk[* or pavement, for those outside the U.S.]
 was brutally  
 besieged by  
 huge turtles  
 of uncertain  
 powers.  CRASH,  
 down fell  
 Elston smashing  
 the chocolate  
 truffles into  
 pulp. A    
 Jedi hamster  
 without force  
 scraped up  
 the remains  
 of poor    
 mendicant penguins  
 from outerspace  
 . The hamster  
 resuscitated eight  
 tiny reindeer  
 whose deflated  
 and crushed  
 weather balloons  
 don't fly  
 because they  
 leak terribly.  
 Elston felt  
 disappointed that  
 nobody would  
 bring his  
 bat to     
 school for  
 flying lessons  
 , but nocturnal  
 schools refused  
 responsibility for  
 airborne insectivores  
 playing cricket.  
 Disgruntled, Elston  
 stomped away  
 toward Elsie  
 to ask     
 how many   
 angels could  
 dance on   
 a piñata   
 without getting  
 hit by     
 a pathological  
 pin. Meanwhile,  
 back at    
 Casa Plátano,  
 Gluefoot's family
 boot scootin  
 to the     
 strains of  
 Disco Duck.  
 "Yikes, foul  
 er, fowl
 play, quacked  
 Elston's deprived  
 and paltry  
 cheerleading squad  
 went to    
 the prom   
 wearing only  
 Toto's tutu.  
 The prom   
 and Toto   
 were quite  
 diverting, but  
 cricket was  
 better than  
 betting on  
 Toto's shoes.  
 "Please tell  
 me where   
 the bananas  
 buy pyjamas  
 , bunny slippers  
 and bunny  
 ears," the  
 clue being  
 Gluefoot's fascination  
 with the   
 bottom of  
 Bunny Bonny,  
 because bouncy  
 Butcher Bob  
 bobbled baseballs  
 balefully beneath  
 blustering blizzards  
 bugging Bullfinch's  
 best buddy  
 besides Boris  
 and his    
 cantankerous conspirator  
 , Curmudgeonly Camilla  
 who likes  
 marzipan bananas.

 Dasterdly Donny  
 despised dumplings  
 dipped directly  
 down dangerously  
 into his   
 ever evolving  
 eggplant eggnog
 . Culinary evolution  
 , an obvious  
 recipe for  
 fearsome flatulence,  
 flaming furiously  
 from foolish  
 fiendish felons  
 from Florida.  
 "Good grieve,  
 gooey geysers
 going gloppishly  
 glug-glug, glug-glug  
 generating gruesome  
 gases!" gushed  
 Gluefoot, gagging  
 guts grossly.  
 Happily, his  
 hunchback had  
 hairy hips  
 horrifically hanging  
 haplessly horizontally  
 helping hold  
 hyperactive hippopotami  
 hopping hooves  
 harmlessly hovering  
 here.  Hallelujah!  
 If it      
 is impossibly  
 icy in     
 igloos' interiors  
 , I'd ignite  
 insatiable interest  
 in innovative  
 introductory indexing  
 , without worrying  
 about alphabetical  
 elegancies because  
 overrated alliteration  
 annoys absolutely  
 everyone that  
 is forced  
 to follow  
 another person's  
 pointless paradigms.  
 Nevertheless, nothing  
 quintessentially quaint  
 did disturb  
 my mother's  
 alphabetic absence.  
 Bruised by  
 constant changes  
 deluding diligent  
 garden gnomes,  
 excited elephants  
 and antelopes,  
 black &amp; blue  
 from fighting  
 gnarled gnus  
 , not knowing
 how hazardous
 living life  
 can be.    
 Usually understanding  
 when it    
 came to    
 personal difficulties,  
 Elston went  
 home screaming.  
 Then he    
 lay down   
 determined to  
 change his  
 clothes when  
 Fluffy pirates  
 came running  
 in the     
 (edited to add split word from previous page ... the)ir tutus  
 and danced  
 with hippos  
 : a parody  
 of Tchaikovsky's  
 Dance of
 the Sugared-Rum  
 Fluffy Pirates.  
 The applause  
 elephant pirates  
 produced was  
 reminiscent of  
 Tchaikovsky's other  
 piratical masterpiece,  
 aaarrrrr the-pirate-and-the-wench  
 in Shanghai  
 rhyming slang  
 and cooking  
 Arrrrange Chicken.  
 in a       
 horse-drawn carriage  
 , laughing with  
 piratical glee.  
 The ocean  
 seethed with  
 furious barnacles  
 raking over  
 the sailboats  
 and desperately  
 clinging on  
 Elston trumpeted  
 , "Heeeeeelp!" In  
 Arabic, which  
 caused great  
 confusion amongst  
 flee pirates  
 .  However, Elston  
 was patient  
 with Janet
 when she   
 slept late  
 on weekends.  
 He only    
 knew one   
 thing about  
 sleeping patterns
 and it     
 involved narcolepsy.  
 "Never mind  
 me," said  
 Elston. "I'll  
 stay awake  
 to do      
 my experiments."  
 "Be very  
 cautious," warned  
 her dreams  
 that night,  
 a pirate   
 arrived, swashbuckling  
 ,but quietly  
 so not     
 everyone can  
 hear the   
 rum bottles  
 yo ho      
 ho! The    
 yardarm was  
 ripped from  
 the yardarm?  
 Scurvy dogs  
 ran around  
 barefeet and  
 bled from  
 their gums  
 at gunpoint.  
 Holding steady  
 and crying, "  
 they didn't  
 make them  
 like the   
 old masters  
 still life  
 goes on",  
 wept Elston,  
 while reading  
 the newspaper.  
 Suddenly, he  
 stopped sobbing  
 and jumped  
 into his   
 puce Corvette  
 heading towards  
 the sea.   
 After a    
 downhill dragrace  
 nearly killing  
 eight gnomes  
 living beneath  
 eight homes,  
 with their  
 eight spouces,  
 and sixty-four  
 beatle-maniacs,  
 despite the  
 warnings not  
 handcuffed nor  
 appropriately attired  
 they continued  
 until their  
 germination process  
 was over.  
 So, without  
 further ado,  
 Elston dances  
 lightly along  
 while whistling  
 Merry Christmas  
 , war is   
 unpleasant, and  
 traffic is  
 worse. A   
 rapid inspection  
 reveals a  
 gaping crater  
 in Gluefoot's  
 driveway, which  
 made the   
 next decision  
 nearly impossible  
 but Elston  
 nevertheless opted  
 to visit   
 his grandmother.  
 Appearing awkwardly  
 noticing that  
 grandmother looked  
 upset about  
 his appearance  
 , Elston took  
 twenty dollars  
 without asking  
 and spent  
 it on      
 a silk     
 handkerchief. It  
 was most   
 decorative on  
 his tusk,  
 and showed  
 family spirit.  
 His grandmother,  
 pleased with  
 Elston's élan  
 , promised to  
 make him   
 a matching  
 tea cozy.  
 Red and    
 puce sequins  
 artfully sequenced  
 between orange  
 and grapefruit  
 segments, with  
 asbestos insulation  
 to finish  
 .  Regardless, the  
 tea cozy   
 sat prettily  
 on the     
 fakir's bed  
 surrounded by  
 7,639 small  
 doilies from  
 recycled paper  
 , sequins, and  
 garters made  
 of tattered  
 paper. His  
 grandfather was  
 frightened by  
 the sudden  
 onslaught of  
 doilies, and  
 garters decided  
 it was     
 nobler to  
 give away  
 the whole  
 caboodle than  
 to remain  
 blinded by  
 puce sequins.  
 Eagerly he  
 called his  
 material girl  
 and asked  
 if she     
 could sing  
 "Material Girl."  
 Grandfather danced  
 while preaching  
 to the     
 unwashed masses  
 as they    
 dug their  
 hands through  
 barrels of  
 orphaned socks,  
 finding muddy  
 relicts from  
 athletic events  
 . Alas, they  
 smelled awful.  
 In order   
 to mitigate  
 the fumes  
 , their manager  
 liberally applied  
 oil of     
 oregano on  
 macaroni cheese  
 and filled  
 choux pastry  
 with sage.  
 Cook socks  
 with onions  
 , if you   
 don't dilute  
 with bleach  
 or thinner  
 then add   
 marzipan and  
 plenty of  
 buttery toffee  
 to finish!  
 means no   
 Add salt   
 and pepper  
 in increasing  
 amounts, chocolate  
 to taste,  
 drop in    
 some nuts  
 , raisins, and  
 lemon drops  
 for half   
 simmer slowly  
 a week,    
 finally you  
 add more   
 orphaned socks  
 , and voilà!  
 Oh......Rocky!  
 Dinnertime for  
 the lion   
 Candied Socks.  
 Anyway, if  
 anybody really
 wants Candied  
 Claw Clippings  
 to serve   
 their guests,  
 Werewolf claws  
 are most   
 delicious when  
 coated with  
 sharp shards  
 of toffee,  
 and drenched  
 with pomegranate  
 pulp and   
 maple syrup.  
 Bake for   
 three days  
 at 750     
 feet exactly,  
 and then   
 cool in    
 a pool     
 until the  
 next morning.  
 Serve over  
 and over   
 until you  
 run out    
 of steam.    
 BUT WAIT,  
 remember that  
 Elston doesn't  
 wear socks  
 in jabber  
 , but yellow  
 with lurid  
 puce checks  
 balanced by  
 tartan scarves  
 nonchalantly wrapped  
 like dolmades  
 are whenever  
 they're defrosted  
 to quickly.  
 Well, thought  
 Elston, I'd  
 better get  
 off to     
 the deli   
 to buy     
 some more  
 week old   
 frankfurters. They're  
 rubbery but  
 just right  
 for the    
 weiner jousting  
 tournament tomorrow.  
 In preparation  
 for the    
 chivalrous contest  
 he took    
 care filing  
 his teeth  
 , toenails and  
 calluses, but  
 forgot to  
 take care  
 to find    
 his frankfurter  
 and did    
 a test     
 on his     
 trunk instead.  
 Agitated, he  
 couldn't maintain  
 his balance  
 so reached  
 for a      
 star and   
 caught instead  
 a comet.   
 But he     
 doggedly continued  
 without marzipan  
 for his    
 Halloween treats.  
 If you     
 must know,  
 Elston couldn't  
 resist anything  
 chocolate, especially  
 deviously rich,  
 chocolate covered,  
 marzipan. Excitedly  
 ignoring guilty  
 pleasures, Elston  
 refused to  
 compromise, insisting  
 on marzipan  
 made with  
 mentor assistance  
 by little  
 steps in   
 the best   
 way possible.  
 Dismayed, Elston  
 screams when  
 he suddenly  
 realized that  
 the tense  
 situation initiated  
 by recalibration  
 of the     
 Snorgle-Splat fails  
 to move    
 the audience  
 After that  
 display of  
 terrible grammar    
 displayed by  
 rebellious proofers  
 Elston tried  
 once again  
 to get     
 some food  
 for his    
 hungry tummy.  
 Although many  
 growls were  
 heard, the  
 appetite couldn't  
 be suppressed  
 , only by  
 sheer will  
 did Elston  
 resist the  
 butterfly of  
 long words.  
 Does eating  
 actually require  
 long butterflies?  
 Long tusks  
 are helpful,  
 but do     
 tail tales  
 explain why  
 tusk-speared marshmallows  
 taste better  
 than fresh  
 when they  
 are toasted  
 . Halloween is  
 approaching rapdily  
 --I mean   
 Samhain--and  
 we will    
 require additional  
 witches to  
 brew the   
 snake and  
 crabapple cider.  
 Strangely enough,  
 the brew   
 didn't turn  
 people green.  
 However, it  
 did make  
 their tongues  
 glow in    
 soft purple  
 and blue.  
 Too embarrassed  
 to show    
 anyone, Elston  
 quickly grabbed  
 a napkin   
 and pretends  
 he was     
 preparing for  
 a huge     
 sneeze that  
 would gravely  
 disturb the  
 well-being of  
 elephant proofreaders  
 afternoon tea.  
 The next   
 time Elston  
 needed elevenses  
 he called  
 Mr. Gruber  
 and said,  
 "Would you  
 join me    
 in a       
 deliciously decadent  
 piece of   
 tuskish delight  
 , chocolate marzipan  
 while we
 discuss our  
 Halloween Bash.  
 Trunks of  
 costumes were  
 hauled in  
 from South  
 Dakota but  
 the elephants  
 were too   
 preoccupied with  
 frivolous pursuits  
 and frivolous  
 discussions until  
 , sadly, the  
 the elephants  
 ran out    
 of tea.    
 It was     
 a disaster  
 for those  
 poor elephants  
 until the  
 caffeine patches  
 kicked in.  
 Caffinated elephants!  
 trumpeting rudely  
 like crazed  
 red bellied  
 sapsuckers careening  
 from here  
 at speeds  
 unheard of  
 until now.  
 OH MY.     
 Does anyone  
 remember how  
 tuskish delight  
 induced raptures  
 at tea-time?  
 A cousin   
 arrived with  
 loads of   
 precious metals  
 previously owned  
 by gorillas,  
 for the    
 purpose of  
 making the  
 extravagent cups  
 extravagantly valuable.  
 Almond Biscotti  
 was served  
 , Chocolati Marzipani  
 was also   
 elegantly presented  
 on Halloween  
 despite the  
 large eggs  
 having been  
 under cooked  
 for three  
 long hours.  
 Justified and  
 quite replete,  
 Elston and  
 his family  
 Butler's starched  
 to etch    
 the linens  
 sufficiently for  
 the creation  
 of more    
 flying rugs.  
 A toupee   
 is also    
 quite delectable  
 when prepared  
 during heavy  
 metal concerts  
 where the  
 banging of  
 heads loosen  
 the hairs.  
 Growing bold  
 certainly means  
 losing all  
 credibility as  
 be tempted  
 a qualified  
 hamburger flipper,  
 but then   
 carefully crowned  
 teeth are  
 worth the  
 pain and   
 , potentially, the  
 greater likelihood  
 of cost    
 *ing more money.  
 Being poor  
 substitutes for  
 a frivolous  
 existence that  
 rich people  
 will never  
 buy, they  
 squat slowly  
 behind dense  
 daffodils and  
 iron gates,  
 hoping fervently  
 not to     
 awaken the  
 guard squirrels.  
 They also  
 mould tiny  
 ceramic elephants,  
 using toothpicks  
 for detailed  
 tusks and  
 to impress  
 all the    
 eligible young  
 cannibals gathered  
 for lunch.    
 However, elephants  
 aren't cannibals,  
 and, furthermore,  
 elephants' tusks  
 curve, unlike  
 cannibal teeth  
 rounded at  
 the roots.  
 Always eat  
 at the     
 base of    
 a carrot   
 when you   
 imitate Bugs  
 Bunny. It  
 saves a    
 tremendous amount  
 when you   
 know how   
 easily forgotten  
 a birthday  
 can be.    
 Oh, no!    
 Mothers birthdays  
 require twenty-seven  
 hugs and   
 breakfast on  
 a homemade  
 tea tray   
 and don't  
 forget to  
 place the  
 Birthday Card  
 next to    
 a huge     
 picture of  
 Medusa, captioned  
 "Mom, I  
 wish I     
 were an    
 elephant, because  
 elephants have  
 the ability  
 to float   
 whenever they  
 cover themselves  
 completely with  
 antibacterial soap  
 and they   
 are so     
 excited when  
 they find  
 something challenging  
 and fly    
 specks haven't  
 made it    
 yet. Unaware  
 of the     
 throw rug  
 in front   
 facing smartly  
 at him     
 , Elston collapsed  
 exhausted from  
 attempting to  
 run in     
 a tight    
 skirt and  
 high heels  
 . He wasn't  
 surprised that  
 the outcome  
 of such    
 an odd     
 occurence had  
 consumed his  
 unflagging energy  
 for dancing.  
 Dancing With  
 Canada Geese  
 is planned  
 for the    
 next big   
 PBS special  
 for fund-raising  
 and features  
 loosers like  
 Jerry Springer  
 jiving and  
 tap dancing  
 to classical  
 polkas, accompanied  
 by Lawrence  
 and Olly,  
 the old    
 owl. When  
 PBS tries  
 to air     
 this insane  
 farrago of  
 junk, most  
 of the     
 media barons  
 will copy  
 Jerry Springer,  
 by bringing  
 about their  
 secret love  
 of Canadian  
 folk singers  
 to prominence.  
 Pumpkin patches  
 are marvelous  
 places to  
 dance in   
 , except when  
 the pumpkins  
 get underfoot.  
 Strawberry fields  
 forever will  
 trump pumpkin  
 fanatics, clearly  
 pinochle fanatics.  
 Pinochle pumpkins,  
 painted purple  
 pretty persistently,  
 party popularly  
 , just not  
 particularly pleasant.  
 ready for  
 Halloween yet?  
 This question  
 leads to   
 a hard     
 decision. To  
 decorate the  
 pumpkins, or  
 die without  
 eating candy-corn.  
 I think    
 , therefore I  
 mistakes I  
 decorate or perish  
 , I will   
 remember. Thus  
 spoke the  
 Great Halloween  
 Pumpkin when  
 it arrived  
 worn a'top  
 Snoopy's head.  
 Halloween jewellery  
 is frequently  
 rather ghoulish  
 and popular  
 at the     
 festivals that  
 promote Marzipan  
 Elephant worship.  
 Weddings however  
 were held  
 in the     
 soft gazebo,  
 on mats    
 made of    
 sticky rice.  
 Bamboo leaves  
 hastily.  Thus  
 was also   
 falling stickily  
 in love    
 whenceforth mushy  
 peas and   
 chocolate marzipan  
 mix, producing  
 green chocolates  
 . Ugh! No  
 deal buddy,  
 mourned the  
 members of  
 his favorite  
 hangout, strictly  
 ballroom dancing  
 , not that!  
 Quel horror!
 exclaimed the  
 danseur celèbre,  
 at the     
 sound of   
 foghorns booming.  
 VanMorrison  
 appeared suddenly  
 singing elephant  
 hymns while  
 dancing too.  
 Elston's costume  
 fitted perfectly.  
 Halloween hijinks  
 are hazardous  
 to your    
 avatars--eeekkkkkkk  
 holiday happiness  
 health, when  
 lawn decorations  
 accumulate waist-high  
 hiding dancing  
 midget stars  
 on dope.   
 Happy Halloween!  
 said Zeberdee  
 , who refused  
 to allow   
 little kids  
 to say     
 trick or   
 treat, smell  
 the complete  
 works of   
 rolled dhal  
 left out   
 of the     
 rain on    
 my porch   
 behind the  
 glowing pumpkin  
 last night.  
 Only jibber-jabber  
 said Jabberwock  
 and he     
 took a     
 plane to   
 visit Elston  
 who wasn't  
 there. Meanwhile,  
 a stray    
 wombat appeared  
 atop the   
 bending tree  
 , shouting "Hey --  
 anyone fancy  
 some chocolate  
 marzipan elephants?"  
 Elston nodded  
 in agreement  
 even though  
 he wasn't  
 tightly woven  
 has nothing  
 into the   
 warp.  Help!  
 My trousers  
 have disintegrated!  
 And now    
 in solitude  
 he wonders  
 which horse  
 will win   
 the lottery  
 and become  
 the next   
 equine astronaut.  
 This year  
 fortunes run  
 around in  
 ever increasing  
 spirals of  
 spinach pasta  
 in a       
 never ending  
 horse race
 around the  
 track. This  
 fountain pen  
 always blots  
 ink on     
 full-moons when  
 hounds howl  
 and geldings  
 grumble. Gnomes  
 nimbly skipped  
 across fjords  
 on jet-ski's  
 wearing only  
 purple tu-tus  
 over their  
 ancient, wrinkled  
 skin..... A  
 rare sight  
 for sore   
 eyes. However,  
 wet feet   
 , muddy puddles  
 , and floppy  
 ears don't  
 a hero     
 make.  Rather,  
 strong hands,  
 strong coffee,  
 will power  
 and cupcakes  
 will always  
 support those  
 cunningly disguised  
 followers of  
 the Fraternity  
 who frequent  
 hallowed halls  
 of castles.  
 Beneath the  
 blue suburban  
 is a       
 street paved  
 with the   
 remnants of  
 spoiled marzipan  
 and muddy  
 bannana peels.  
 When the   
 bell tolls  
 for thee,  
 ," Elston quoted,  
 suppressing his  
 wild giggling  
 laughter, that  
 threatened to  
 drown out  
 the voices  
 . But they  
 ignored him  
 completely, and  
 went on    
 making funny  
 noises whenever  
 they heard  
 a ferry    
 toot. Does  
 that mean  
 we can't   
 toll the   
 bells of   
 St. Michael's Cathedral  
 two peals  
 a day?     
 Well, perhaps  
 it is      
 preferable to  
 more usefull  
 to knock   
 and wait   
 for the    
 butler to  
 do the     
 bidding of  
 my Lady.   
 After contemplating  
 how she    
 had arranged  
 the flowers  
 I realized  
 that there  
 weren't any  
 purple gladioli  
 or chartreuse  
 carnations in  
 the vase.  
 Elston picked  
 the yellow  
 tulips from  
 the neighbours  
 estate and  
 willed himself  
 to give    
 a donation  
 to compensate  
 for the    
 deceitful way  
 in which   
 he acquired  
 the bouquet.  
 However, his  
 grandmother was  
 long gone  
 having been  
 captured and  
 subjected to  
 a free     
 Strine dictionary  
 . Strewth, cobber!  
 This cryptic  
 vernacular has  
 just about  
 made things  
 difficult to  
 comprehend when  
 suffering from  
 brain drain.  
 The captain  
 ruffled his  
 parrot's feathers  
 and asked,  
 "If twenty-three  
 doubloons can't  
 buy him    
 rare books  
 on parchment,  
 then what  
 should he  
 squander it  
 on?" This  
 seemingly unanswerable  
 question plagued  
 everyone who  
 dealt yellow  
 fellows to  
 all other  
 players. But,  
 contrary to  
 poorly translated  
 medical texts  
 , this particularly  
 odd combination  
 failed to  
 come to    
 anyones attention.  
 That's why  
 one should  
 invariably quote  
 the proper  
 sources. However,  
 pasta sauce  
 sticks better  
 when it's  
 got plenty  
 of industrial  
 adhesives mixed  
 with bananas  
 showing layers  
 like lasagna.  
 Regardless, this  
 to do      
 with proofers  
 and Foofers,  
 let alone  
 project facilitators  
 whose Lycra  
 miniskirts never  
 rise above  
 the ankle.  
 Content providers  
 however wear  
 elastic suspenders,  
 foofy wigs,    
 unless they  
 are natural  
 book fairies.  
 Old books  
 spread dangerous  
 myths, legends,  
 ungodly theories,  
 etc. but   
 new books  
 are even   
 worse: they  
 are devoid  
 of worthwhile  
 subjects that  
 are not    
 commonly contemplated.  
 Elston scanned  
 the horizon  
 for signs  
 of   :IsThisaDragon:'s  
 whatever those  
 things are.  
 Having misread  
 the almanac  
 , his timing  
 was off
 because moon-dragons  
 can't count  
 higher than  
 1,048,575, so  
 he decided
 lickity splickity  
 to learn   
 some songs  
 about  :IsThisaDragon:  
 (not purple!)  
 but blue.  
 Orange, moondragon  
 of the     
 high chaparral  
 overlooking piebald  
 thought, "these  
 inflamed passions  
 are beyond  
 my experience  
 ," and turned  
 away from  
 the abysmal  
 depths of  
 human ignorance,  
 and back   
 towards the  
 soaring heights  
 of brute   
 elephant/dinosaur  
 tribal knowledge.  
 Distributed elephants  
 occupy more  
 crowded nightclubs  
 nowadays, because  
 obese zebras  
 never dare  
 to enter   
 the house  
 of ill     
 ostriches. Clubbing  
 does occur  
 every Thursday  
 in the     
 backstreets of  
 www.pgdp.net but  
 never in   
 a serious  
 mentor/mentee conversation.  
 Elston asked,  
 trumpetting in  
 marvelous synchronicity  
 , could he  
 possibly go  
 snipe hunting  
 without getting  
 in a       
 new humvee?  
 "Of Course,"  
 mumbled an  
 old ant    
 squirming into  
 his home.  
 "Sweet home",  
 Alabama" sang  
 Tennessee River  
 hopelessly tuneless.  
 "Encore!" cried  
 eight dwarves  
 sang goodbye.  
 Too tall   
 to fall    
 too small  
 to post    
 but most   
 of the     
 dwarves fell  
 about laughing  
 and swilling  
 Whilst carousing  
 drunkenly.  How  
 drunkenly, is  
 demonstrated by  
 magic diagrams  
 drawn on   
 Marzipan-boards in  
 red crayon.  
 The child  
 refused to  
 give up    
 pulling flowers  
 off the    
 purse of   
 Lady Dirigible  
 , who happened  
 to be      
 proofreading pages  
 on Eugenics  
 can be     
 so entertaining  
 to hedgehogs.  
 Hedgehogs scare  
 many people,  
 especially civilized  
 and over-achieving  
 types who  
 seldom stalk  
 spineless aristocrats  
 or penniless  
 cheese-eating monks  
 who read   
 Spinoza. Philisophers,  
 stoned or  
 ungrateful delinquents  
 depending upon  
 the kindness  
 of strangers  
 will always  
 find a     
 kindred spirit  
 in bars    
 serving Midori  
 , marzipan chasers,  
 and nuts.  
 They also  
 use quills  
 plucked from  
 ostrich feathers  
 by mandrills  
 . The ink  
 flows best  
 when conscientiously  
 applied to  
 the insides  
 of platens  
 of typewriters  
 only if    
 the moon   
 their name  
 is full.   
 However, it  
 appears frightful  
 and strangely  
 --yet wonderfully--  
 attractive at  
 once. Ink  
 has never  
 nauseated octopuses  
 , no matter  
 how weak   
 their constitutions.  
 their constitutions  
 Echo's seem  
 seem prevalent  
 , entering rings  
 of solid   
 golden voices  
 sounding plastic  
 and tinny.  
 But Mozart  
 eschewed such  
 luxuries as  
 mud pies   
 garnished with  
 fresh parsley.  
 He prefers  
 simple dishes  
 prepared properly  
 with sweetbreads  
 crumbed and  
 deep-fried in  
 chicken fat  
 and accompanied  
 spiciest frog  
 who likes  
 volcano chili.  
 But snakes  
 only eat   
 sweetbreads if  
 they are   
 sautéed in  
 a light    
 beer batter  
 and placed  
 on a       
 bed of     
 gently wilted  
 earthworm segments.  
 Elephants however,  
 will graze  
 amoung the  
 golden daffodils  
 along with  
 marzipan idols  
 , chocolate frogs  
 and anything  
 else that  
 eats chocolate.  
 One of     
 best things  
 about parachutes  
 is their   
 unreliable attitude  
 towards members  
 of the     
 press who  
 fall from  
 twelfth-floor balconies.  
 Which is   
 no longer  
 unusually high  
 considering they  
 are merely  
 relative to  
 an ant.    
 "Nice hat,"  
 said the   
 squire to  
 the bishop.  
 Elston's confusion  
 choosing hats  
 colorfully blocked  
 and felted  
 was that
 Christmas avatars  
 had taken  
 preternatural control  
 of the     
 numismatic underworld  
 causing it  
 to implode.  
 This confusion  
 started a  
 brain twist  
 last summer  
 in the     
 dark caves  
 beneath Elston's  
 armpits. Elston  
 cried, darkly,  
 "Begone! Thou  
 demons of  
 Maxwellian persuasion!"  
 Smart guys  
 do not     
 worry about  
 contractions or  
 ellipsis without  
 consulting oracles  
 that use   
 telephone shoes  
 to tell    
 The Guideline.  
 Quickly recovering  
 the sofa   
 after Gluefoot  
 (long story!)  
 scrunched it,  
 Elston put  
 his elephant  
 jammies on  
 and sat    
 down on    
 (expletive deleted)  
 with a     
 great thump.  
 Poor Elston!  
 Drycleaners don't  
 make housecalls  
 , so he    
 had to     
 take the   
 A Train    
 during rushhour  
 , carrying his  
 grimy howdah  
 precariously on





(had to look that up!)  
 a baby-carriage.  
 teetering precariously  
 can be     
 dangerous indeed.  
 Elston drove  
 his grandmother  
 nuts, but  
 dancing elephants  
 delight grandmothers  
 with their  
 , nobody will  
 twinkling toes.  
 and long   
 tusk tassels.  
 The pig    
 in tutu    
 delighted the  
 audience, even  
 as Elston  
 said 'oink'  
 and made   
 shadow pictures  
 on the     
 floor.  The  
 picture of  
 which surprised 
 him the    
 least failed  
 to pass    
 muster with  
 the illustrators  
 who were   
 fiddling with  
 pictures. Tomorrow  
 passing mustard  
 before every  
 pickled hedgehog  
 will cause  
 Santa to   
 regret his  
 indulgence in  
 sour food.  
 Preferring marzipan  
 spiked with  
 Midori and  
 a map      
 showing echidna-friendly  
 cities with  
 old-fashioned delicatessens
 , Elston complained  
 bitterly about  
 the lack   
 of interest  
 in marzipan  
 shaped as  
 Christmas trees.  
 Alone, Elston  
 stood fast  
 , refusing to  
 give up    
 his right  
 to be      
 treated with  
 the polite  
 attitude due  
 to magnificent  
 , albeit eccentric,  
 pink elephants.     
 Nonetheless, elephants  
 can behave  
 in the     
 most elegant  
 and genteel  
 manner. Thus  
 Elston dances  
 the fandango  
 then he    
 trumpets loudly  
 to drown   
 the meeping  
 of the






(meep! meep!)  
 coyote, who  
 fancied marzipan,  
 but only   
 mint flavored  
 . That, of  
 all things,  
 caused the  
 his fur    
 to turn    
 pink sandy  
 white with  
 flecks of  
 gold leaf.  
 The expenses  
 incurred by  
 Elston while  
 on his     
 most recent  
 escapade made  
 his accountant  
 have fits.  
 Chocolate made  
 everything better,  
 as it      
 always does.  
 Not knowing  
 the exact  
 hat size   
 Elston knitted  
 an enormous  
 paisley toque  
 using giant  
 wooden needles  
 because elephants  
 would never  
 forget their  
 fear for   
 toque guerillas.  
 who always  
 spell out  
 each word  
 when proofreading  
 pachyderm pornography.  
 That way   
 prominently on








{Seriously though, check out "The Elephant is Slow to Mate" by T.S. Eliot}  
 naked rocks  
 with green  
 eyeliner. Coldly  
 surveying his  
 fridge as  
 old produce  
 stank, Elston  
 debated if  
 hired housekeepers  
 were worth  
 the risk.  
 They tend  
 to toss    
 pizzas up  
 so high    
 the ceiling-fans  
 slice and  
 catching them  
 making sure  
 they don't  
 splosh over  
 respectable sentences.  
 After all,  
 that's the  
 point of   
 writing stuff  
 correctly, if  
 one cares  
 so much    
 to proofread  
 when under  
 the influence.  
 Seasonal libations  
 are your   
 worst choice.  
 Of course,  
 Elston always  
 drinks in  
 the bathtub,  
 being somewhat  
 inebriated by  
 drinking bathtub  
 gin, but   
 this minor  
 tipple didn't  
 compare to  
 Valentine's Day  
 when Elston  
 actually spilled  
 an exquisite  
 bottle of  
 faux olive  
 in a       
 passionate pirouette  
 , indicating that  
 it is      
 time for   
 slightly less  
 to drink.  
 Elephants rarely  
 drink before  
 10 a.m.    
 except when  
 working nights.  
 A healthy  
 liver can  
 be eaten   
 with onions  
 usually causes  
 .  Baking cookies  
 stuck to   
 the pan    
 is one     
 of the     
 whilst juggling  
 problems you  
 wish didn't  
 multiply like  
 rabbits do.  
 Multiplying elephants  
 or relatives  
 can divide  
 while adding  
 and subtracting  
 gleefully. They  
 take away  
 one's breath  
 without playing  
 accordion sonatas  
 at 2A.M.   
 Additionally, it  
 seems antisocial  
 to negate  
 seasonal bonhomie  
 during sports.  
 However, exercise  
 your mind  
 not body   
 and all    
 that goes  
 will come  
 and wither  
 whether or  
 not it     
 makes sense.  
 Once upon  
 a plateau  
 a mouse    
 faced Elston  
 who screamed  
 and flattened  
 his wrinkled  
 and purple  
 toes into  
 eggplants.  They  
 squelched deliciously  
 as he      
 ran to     
 and fro    
 chasing ducks.  
 Do ducks   
 care about  
 hedgehogs or  
 marzipan dainties  
 with gingerbread  
 wild men?  
 Yes, if    
 only to    
 outclass koalas  
 at the     
 local pond.  
 All I      
 want for   
 Christmas is  
 Cheez Whiz  
 and no     
 one talking  
 about giraffes.  
 Poor Elston  
 didn't know  
 long-necked spotted  
 animals are  
 hard to    
 entertain, and  
 impulsively buy  
 stripped neckties.  
 Piebald beans  
 remind Elston  
 of the     
 halcyon days  
 of his     
 early youth.  
 Whereas boiled  
 until soft  
 then post-processed  
 ancient Latin  
 magic beans  
 remind him  
 of leathery  
 book bindings  
 and high-school.  
 These memories  
 brought a  
 moment of  
 quiet reflection  
 , very unusual  
 onboard ship  
 while at   
 *tempting the limbo  
 extra words  
 can prove  
 irresistible when
 distracted by  
 wandering reindeer  
 pulling carriages  
 on wintry  
 nights.  This  
 Christmas Eve  
 , Santa and  
 his helpers 
 are traveling  
 incognito so  
 Santa-land police  
 can't prevent  
 Santa speeding  
 through the  
 urban neighbourhood.  
 speed-bumps notwithstanding  
 the sleigh  
 , deer-eight powered  
 avoided crashing  
 . Despite reckless  
 pedestrians and  
 stray dogs  
 chasing one  
 clobbering another  
 .  The candles  
 burn brightly  
 for those  
 lost travellers  
 riding camels  
 across the  
 vast terrain  
 protected by  
 Janice, the  
 ferocious Rottweiler  
 who likes  
 gnawing at  
 chocolate marzipan  
 and whatever  
 other Monarchs  
 are available.  
 Butterflies tend  
 to butter  
 their flies  
 of Velcro
 whilst strapping  
 under milkweed
 their eggs.  
 Nesting quietly  
 , far from  
 erudite proofreaders,  
 and prolific  
 progenitors of  
 punniness and
 silly sounds
 proposed permanent  
 permafrost-proof  
 cabins, containing  
 deliberately deceitful  
 mis-leading links  
 and all    
 filthy formatters  
 needing sausage  
 to be      
 foofing fluently.  
 What wackiness  
 awaits diligent  
 readers of  
 misused Forums  
 , antique Guidelines,  
 and dancing  
 await updating  
 when the   
 proofreadlers evade  
 capture when  
 spurious letters  
 impersonate alphabetical  
 bacon catchers  
 delaying elephants  
 farting groofers  
 harrying insolent  
 jumping kangaroos  
 leaping merrily  
 north of   
 Peloponnesia. Querulous  
 reawaking Santa  
 took up    
 Virginia's wish
 ; x-raying your  
 zygotes and  
 blasting chromosomes  
 with fiery  
 dragons' breath  
 marks the  
 end.  Rainbows  
 disappoint, despite  
 chromatic colours  
 being beautiful.  
 Ask anybody  
 what the   
 dickens this  
 means, because  
 average novels  
 have direction  
 in that    
 they are   
 read in    
 the dictionary.  
 You people  
 haven't seen  
 friendly but  
 reticent elephants  
 dancing on  
 tables find  
 problems with  
 their grammar.  
 Elston decided  
 to stop    
 using punctuation  
 , but the  
 elephants disagreed.  
 The color  
 pink was   
 painted over  
 because elephants  
 can't stand  
 being mistaken  
 for hallucinations;  
 their self-confidence  
 is not     
 good when  
 that happens.   
 CHAPTER TWO  
 A lovely   
 jade green  
 vase with  
 elephant ears  
 depicted under  
 a large    
 mosaic rendition  
 of Hannibal  
 Lecter. Which  
 should not  
 be handled  
 without proper  
 precautions.  Rubber  
 hoses made  
 Elston's legs  
 tremble horribly.  
 A re-occuring  
 theme here  
 with variations  
 is Elston's  
 home cooking,  
 finger licking  
 but not    
 exactly healthy,  
 like deep-fried  
 Snickers bars  
 and taffy.  
 Elston is
 quite large,  
 compared to  
 others who  
 know him.

For the benfit of new people here, this :dancingelephant: is Elston.
If you see a reference to Gluefoot this  :dancingbanana: is him.  He is generally consider as Elston's evil oppposite.  

 His diet   
 lacked fibre  
 , like bananas,     
 oat glazed  
 stewed prunes,  
 beans and  
 cabbage. As  
 we all     
 love fiber  
 with its   
 gassy nature  
 and delicate  
 action, we  
 entreat Elston  
 to consume  
 lots of    
 chocolate marzipan  
 is good    
 and helps  
 the fiber  
 bond tightly  
 . Excited, Elston  
 bounded across  
 the field  
 of tulips  
 , with a   
 light heart  
 and heavy  
 feet. Meanwhile  
 , Elston's brother-in-law  
 was voted  
 Best Vocalist  
 of the     
 DP Band,

 "Hedgehogs' Heaven"  
 , for yodelling  
 yodel-ya-he-hoo in  
 an impressive  
 outfit, consisting  
 of puce    
 and juice.  
 Dreaming, Elston  
 mused, is  
 hazardously addictive.  
 Counting sheepdogs  
 barking loudly  
 at goats   
 dancing the  
 Bus Stop   
 caused Elston  
 to lose    
 his temper,  
 as well    
 as his     
 hat. He    
 raced after  
 the largest  
 and greenest  
 and by     
 Jove, LOUDEST  
 bicycle riding  
 lizard that  
 was ever   
 able to    
 compere the  
 entire function  
 to a       
 slightly different  
 , yet remarkably  
 similar equation.  
 Weather permitting,  
 there will  
 always be  
 a concert  
 where elephants  
 who like   
 marzipan can  
 Can-Can with  
 mice wearing  
 full armor  
 with chocolate  
 tutus melting  
 away in    
 a mist.    
 However, it  
 is unlikely  
 daily goals  
 can stand  
 the odious  
 inspection by  
 three or   
 more gathered  
 wise hedgehogs.  
 Echidnas, conversely,  
 converse freely  
 while doing  
 calisthenics in  
 starched pinafores  
 aka pinbefores
 that chafe  
 and shave  
 con verses.

 However, wombats  
 can't write  
 romance novels,  
 while they  
 can crush  
 beer cans  
 with great  
 spectacle. Written  
 by emus,   
 with starched  
 pinbefores because  
 sand and   
 salt-water don't  
 belong with  
 laundry soap.  
 Squids can  
 supply ink  
 , and wasps  
 write lucid  
 , if rather  
 grim stories  
 amend to   
 Shakespears works  
 . Calamari rings  
 true whenever  
 it's struck  
 in the     
 instant after  
 the inevitable  
 but still  
 moving tide.  
 Fighting sleep  
 while lying  
 on top     
 of all     
 on eggshells,  
 my wife    
 is drawing  
 portraits of  
 wanted criminals.  
 If you     
 like you   
 and you    
 or you     
 , you might  
 find gradually  
 that climbing  
 is fun.

 On the     
 banks of   
 Switzerland or  
 next to    
 near perfect  
 copies of  
 the Alps,  
 Neddie Seagoon  
 , Eccles, and  
 major Bloodnok  
 discovered a  
 rare species  
 of scanno  
 in the     
 piano Bluebottle  
 mountain range.  
 Little Jim
 ran in     
 excitedly to  
 The Canal  
 Of Doom   
 to tell    
 William that  
 chocolate covered  
 rabbits don't  
 float. Minnie  
 Ha-ha laughed  
 hysterically while  
 trying to  
 wrestle Elston's  
 young cousin  
 because he  
 attempted to  
 retrieve the  
 injured seagull  
 from the   
 jaws of    
 Gluefoot's vise  
 , during a  
 unexpected disturbance  
 caused by  
 militant hedgehogs  
 raising their  
 spines in  
 prickly protest  
 against the  
 incredibly annoying  
 hum of     
 off-tune hummingbirds.  
 flying sideways  
 an imbalance  
 in the     
 cochlea of  
 airborn earthworms  
 without motion  
 sickness, although  
 since earthworms  
 don't have  
 wings . They  
 cannot fly.  
 Confused, Elston  
 examines a  
 leading expert's  
 report on  
 flying hedgehogs.  
 Scratching his  
 lottery ticket,  
 he cried   
 until he   
 realized that  
 the numbers  
 were precisely  
 the size   
 of twenty-seven  
 times his  
 original bet  
 which meant  
 50 cents.  
 After having  
 called his  
 brother in  
 Smoot, Wyoming  
 , Elston took  
 a swim     
 in the     
 Lemonade river  
 and encountered  
 an orange  
 peel boat  
 full of    
 grapefruit people  
 , who shouted  
 loudly at  
 other fruits  
 but were   
 friendly despite  
 not having  
 any sugar  
 for days   
 nor any    
 reason for  
 spooning together  
 . Fruit salad  
 yummy yummy  
 with cream  
 and scones.  
 Poor Elston!  
 Cried the  
 mother of  
 Skippy eaters  
 , who had  
 witnessed poor  
 behaviour on  
 several other  
 occasions.  She  
 decided to  
 throw together  
 peanut butter  
 and jelly  
 soufflés with  
 grapefruit topping.  
 Crumbly little  
 flakes of  
 marzipan and  
 butterscotch flakes  
 are believed  
 to help    
 prevent headaches  
 . This menu  
 for hedgehogs  
 causes indigestion  
 regardless of  
 esophagus size  
 but is     
 alleviated by  
 good ol'   
 However, one  
 satiated hedgehog  
 is enough  
 to blow    
 the entire  
 brass band  
 to the     
 next town  
 , where convivial  
 squirrels can  
 hoard their  
 homemade hooch  
 under Elston's  
 favorite jumper.  
 Rambunctious raccoons  
 raised rare  
 writing wrinkled  
 ridiculous replies  
 relatively rapidly  
 really relying  
 rather righteously  
 and boldly  
 beyond belief  
 upon their  
 bushy tails  
 for balance.  
 This leads  
 kindly lights  
 to the     
 encircling gloom  
 of madness.  
 Wondering what  
 will become  
 of the     
 lights after  
 Twelfth night  
 of flooding  
 causes concern  
 amongst the  
 cognoscenti, who  
 always need  
 much chocolate  
 to relieve  
 stress from  
 too many   
 classical references  
 in one     
 heavily footnoted  
 critical edition  
 of Edmallion's  
 "Exercises in  
 Frustrating Folderol".  
 Don't eat  
 anything that  
 comes from  
 underwater basketweavers  
 bearing bodacious  
 acclaims of  
 weight loss  
 and Bartlett  
 pears. Even  
 though you  
 know they  
 are extremely  
 exotic, tempation  
 for you    
 to eat     
 whenever you  
 feel the   
 urge to    
 gnash teeth  
 on some    
 rock candy.  
 Oh! What   
 fun it     
 would be   
 if the     
 number of  
 elephants in  
 the world  
 where as   
 many as    
 human beings.  
 The sewage  
 spilled over  
 beyond the  
 ridge of   
 the mighty  
 ol' funky  
 Shadow Mountains,  
 creating a  
 zone of    
 horrific smelly  
 swampland below  
 and causing  
 the growth  
 of strange  
 furry beasts  
 with wings.  
 Last Sunday,  
 one of     
 our neighbours  
 visited the  
 fortune teller  
 to ask     
 directions to  
 Garden Gnome  
 City.  The  
 answer was  
 "Hello, we've  
 moved them  
 because elephants  
 often trample  
 on them.   
 Using gnomes-de-plumes  
 the neighbors  
 wrote about  
 30 pages   
 of folderol  
 that needs  
 proofreading. Therefore,  
 let's all  
 put a      
 kibosh on  
 gnome trampling.  
 Dwarve-pinching however,  
 is acceptable.  
 Elston asks,  
 "Why me?"  
 in consternation.  
 Fortunately, nobody  
 dared ask  
 why not.   
 Resignedly, Elston  
 quit worrying  
 about things  
 that were  
 not under  
 his immediate  
 perusal because  
 it only    
 caused him  
 painful gas.  
 Despite all  
 his good   
 behaviour his  
 trunk was  
 sore from  
 prolonged immersion  
 in the     
 frigid waters  
 of Lake    
 Waikikamukau, where  
 loons cavort  
 in the     
 underwater caves.  
 Happily, Elston  
 leapt into  
 frigid waters
 and relished  
 the exhiliration  
 shock of   
 the vast   
 horizon that  
 stretched from  
 his brain  
 outward beyond  
 the ends   
 of his     
 tusks.  "Ouch!"  
 Said the   
 hedgepig, flying  
 drunkenly from  
 his chair  
 in a       
 painful leap  
 of logic   
 that resulted  
 in disaster.  
 What happened?  
 Elston could  
 feel depressed  
 worms under  
 the thawing  
 pizzas that  
 wiggled and  
 look disgusting,  
 but not    
 any crustaceans  
 would agree  
 as they    
 are sometimes  
 hard headed  
 and crabby.  
 Once they  
 open the   
 discussion about  
 claw size  
 affie rapidly  
 began to   
 bounce and  
 run the    
 show. It   
 was an     
 unusual event  
 full of    
 twisted plot  
 , and they  
 measured claws  
 at the     
 DP convention.  
 The party  
 was on!    
 With music  
 and dancing.  
 Everyone was  
 busy proofing  
 the horrid  
 story of   
 the latest  
 hedgehog smuggler  
 "Rolf Henderson  
 and the    
 Prickly Pig."  
 The Latin  
 translation was  
 indecipherable, However  
 the Greek  
 could make  
 you cry.   
 "Eat your  
 broccoli", said  
 Rolf's mother  
 , "it's good  
 , even though  
 it doesn't  
 taste like  
 Grandma's." Later,  
 they ate   
 sardines and  
 petits fours  
 served on  
 mountains of  
 shredded spinach  
 collapsed around  
 salmon mousse.  
 However, when  
 they finished  
 eating the  
 salmon mousse  
 they felt  
 ill and    
 vowed to   
 never eat  
 fish again.  
 However, horse  
 offal makes  
 surprisingly good  
 digestive agent.  
 "EEWWW", said  
 Grandma, with  
 a look     
 behind her  
 refrigerator. "What  
 is THAT    
 hedgehog doing  
 with my    
 prickly pear?"
 Is she     
 really trying  
 to make    
 matters worse?  
 Actually, she  
 is abrogating  
 all chances  
 of ever    
 getting her  
 favourite snack.  
 Snowmen eat  
 before they  
 go snowdropping  
 , so they  
 won't bite  
 little children  
 Can drink  
 copious amounts  
 of antifreeze  
 and lose   
 nothing.  Shut  
 the faucet  
 off when   
 frogs start  
 to croak.  
 This is    
 the only   
 place where  
 fearless mice  
 and men    
 display bizarre  
 behavoir when  
 confronted by  
 dancing elephants  
 flying over  
 in a       
 moment of  
 unparalleled levity.  
 Despite the  
 recent war,  
 it was     
 very quiet  
 when Elston  
 got to     
 try his    
 Nerf gun   
 . It was   
 against the  
 public opinion  
 of squirrels  
 , but then  
 they don't  
 have rights  
 although they  
 should. Actually,  
 if you     
 were to    
 make a     
 nut cake   
 , you'd choose  
 to do      
 the same.  
 "I want  
 my own     
 piece of   
 heavan, however  
 it seems   
 I can't    
 get over   
 raising hell.  
 I think    
 you are    
 quite the  
 ticket, love.  
 Thank you!   :P  
 I like     
 the way    
 the clouds  
 hung over  
 the banister  
 , it was   
 most amusing."  
 Through foggy  
 , foggy nights,  
 and windy  
 , windy days,  
 the very   
 thought of  
 dancing snows  
 made me    
 shiver with  
 contentment. Maybe  
 it will    
 ice over   
 the old    
 bones buried  
 under Gluefoot's  
 rose bushes.  
 Red roses  
 are the    
 joy of     
 spiny anteaters  
 but the    
 yellow roses  
 hedgehogs love.  
 It took    
 rose breeders  
 four centuries  
 to create  
 OCR-able thorns  
 in order   
 to determine  
 the ideal  
 edition of  
 "Roses: Who  
 , How, and  
 Why?" by  
 Fairy Gardenmother  
 Jane&#254;, whose  
 thorny demeanor  
 causes those  
 surprising results  
 while gardening.  
 Wellington boots  
 , not Crocs,  
 are the    
 best kind  
 for when   
 sloshing about  
 in very    
 deep mud.  
 One must   
 , without exception,  
 take care  
 when confronting  
 smiling people  
 in case    
 they belong  
 to any     
 clandestine or  
 pseudo-military organizations.  
 In order   
 to collect  
 tax refunds  
 one must   
 lie unashamedly  
 or stay    
 out of     
 the reach  
 of the     
 tax man.   
 Before placing  
 a bet      
 he calculated  
 that if    
 the worst  
 was to     
 happen he  
 would merely  
 sell his   
 collection of  
 toy trains,  
 matchbook covers,  
 flying toasters,  
 and French  
 -fried spuds  
 which still  
 were wrapped  
 in newspaper.  
 A little   
 bit later  
 on the     
 roof of    
 Schloss Neuschwanstein  
 , Spiderman and  
 paparazzi from  
 the Daily  
 World held  
 proof of   
 Elston's involvement  
 in necromancy.

 However, nobody
 would believe  
 Elston could  
 conjure up  
 twelve blond  
 dancing girls  
 with only  
 the tiniest  
 wisp of    
 turquoise gauze  
 semi-transparent lingerie.  
 "Silly Elston  
 believed in  
 anything he  
 read," sighed  
 his grandmother.  
 Her age    
 old dog    
 looked up  
 from ogling  
 a bone     
 , well chewed,  
 and nearly  
 fell asleep.  
 The fallacy  
 that Squirrels  
 (capital "S")  
 are among  
 endangered species  
 if not     
 already extinct  
 , already refuted  
 to severe  
 and undisputed  
 outcry from  
 all corners  
 of the     
 globe, despite  
 the fact   
 that it's  
 against the  
 law.  March  
 towards the  
 future with  
 no fear!!  
 Before you  
 collapse with  
 laughter, you  
 should ensure  
 all your   
 ducks are  
 thoroughly plucked  
 , stuffed with  
 Key limes  
 and oranges.  
 On second  
 thought, a(n)  
 apple might  
 be the     
 best target  
 instead of  
 a gooseberry  
 only if    
 you want   
 Brown Betty.  
 I heard    
 a strange  
 story yesterday:  
 my neighbor  
 ran naked  
 in the     
 snow, while  
 several onlookers  
 cheered and  
 laughed.  Meanwhile  
 The marsh  
 gas continued  
 to burn    
 unabated, causing  
 a dense    
 crow to    
 roast itself.  
 Crow can   
 be delicious  
 , particularly when  
 paired with  
 pared pears.  
 My aardvark  
 eats only  
 ants and   
 termites.  Pickled  
 pussywillow predominates  
 perhaps portentiously  
 pestering porcupines  
 preening publicly  
 pointed projectiles  
 placed perpendicularly  
 under the
 sheltering boughs  
 around glades  
 and elephants.  
 Patricia persevered
 patiently putting  
 par perfectly  
 persimmon purée  
 , peeled prawns  
 , par-boiled potatoes  
 , poached plaice  
 , pulverized peanuts  
 , processed pork  
 , pickled pussywillow
 and mustard  
 . There's always  
 something to  
 do, but    
 please put  
 a penny    
 farthing under  
 a tarpaulin  
 , to keep  
 his hands  
 off it.    
 A new      
 gnu knew   
 I knew     
 you new,   
 I did!     
 The great  
 thing about  
 hippopotami is  
 the way    
 they wallow  
 in tutu    
 s and keep  
 themselves from  
 worrying about  
 what to    
 wear underneath  
 a tarpaulin  
 in the     
 big show.  
 "The stars,"  
 she muttered  
 "How they  
 twinkle, like  
 popsicle toes  
 on ice.    
 Beware of  
 sozzled elfs  
 and wicked  
 wicket keepers,  
 Red Caps,  
 and other  
 inebriated imps  
 playing pranks  
 on unsuspecting  
 trolls. Mountains  
 , white capped  
 and perilous
 rise sheer  
 and ladderless  
 through the  
 leaden clouds  
 of cyanide.  
 Johnny wants  
 the shiniest
 yellow tractor.  
 A green    
 card must  
 be green   
 , pink, or  
 puce, but  
 never orange.

 Hardly anyone  
 can answer  
 this riddle,  
 which asks  
 a conundrum  
 of sorts   
 ; guess what  
 , better still,  
 we should  
 drink with  
 our friends  
 from down  
 the lane   
 , and then  
 sit under  
 a willow   
 tree chewing  
 straws and  
 talking politics.  
 Oh no,     
 I just     
 lost my    
 way again  
 , please help!  
 Perhaps, where  
 you go     
 is where   
 you need   
 the most   
 direction. You  
 are here!  
 That is    
 exactly what  
 they meant.  
 Elston's storytime  
 begins tomorrow  
 around lunch.  
 Be there!  
 While pondering  
 life's joys  
 under a    
 starry mantle  
 and fine   
 wine, Elston  
 wistfully suggested  
 a tango.   
 So they    
 chose partners,  
 and can-can  
 -cannot re-re-remember  
 how they
 disliked having  
 were expected  
 to play    
 the music  
 amidst all  
 the chattering  
 and stuttering  
 about wordcheck  
 was unknown.  
 Lurking deep  
 in the     
 heart of   
 the ancient  
 group of   
 sinister, reclusive  
 zookeepers lies  
 unbounded vitality  
 to reproduce  
 hordes of  
 killer ants.  
 Sir Nonfat
 his ions   
 dispersed among  
 the masses.  
 Elston scratches  
 his head   
 while he   
 ponders this  
 highly charged  
 question regarding  
 radical dieting.  
 Is it      
 really true  
 that when  
 elephants sigh  
 tigers cry  
 and lions  
 stare woefully  
 at the     
 scarce but  
 often tasty  
 squirrels that  
 keep the   
 wheels greased  
 with suet.  
 Good words  
 lead to    
 good books.  
 Bad words  
 leave a    
 soapy flavor  
 , particularly when  
 a rancid   
 word is    
 left dangling  
 . Good education  
 doesn't work  
 when you   
 say ain't  
 or swear   
 to never   
 study again  
 even when  
 you lack   
 the will   
 to grow.   
 Today, Elston  
 switched stories.  
 Elston also  
 belongs elsewhere.  
 Where did  
 Elston go?  
 Shy goblins  
 hide under  
 Elston's ears  
 and giggle  
 uncontrollably, while  
 Elston cried.  
 Poor Elston,  
 what a     
 commotion those  
 shy goblins  
 , chattering away  
 and laughing  
 uncontrollably when  
 he wanted  
 a drink.   
 Creeping warily  
 past the   
 drowsy gnomes  
 Elston makes  
 it to      
 bed. Portable  
 typewriters make  
 excellent doorstops  
 when thrown  
 against portals  
 or portholes  
 thus causing  
 enough noise  
 and damage  
 to exterminate  
 whiteants permanently.  
 Isn't it   
 lovely what  
 cranky behavior  
 brings out  
 ? Luckily, there  
 were 3     
 wheels on  
 the tricycle.  
 Chuckling quietly  
 , a mischievous  
 tricyclist threw  
 a large    
 fourth wheel  
 onto the   
 bosse's tricycle.  
 Then she   
 attached a  
 air horn   
 to the
 echo chamber  
 and ruptured  
 it. There  
 are more   
 odd things  
 in orbit   
 than you'd  
 like, especially  
 when the   
 starship flys  
 are obitting.  
 More rain  
 fell from  
 Mars today.  
 March rain  
 , April Showers,  
 and May    
 may come   
 in retrospect  
 oblivious to  
 the flowers.  
 Summer will  
 herald drought  
 , plagues of  
 bursting bouquets,  
 and bugs.  
 Happiness is  
 a warm

I couldn't resist. This was too easy.  
 cup of     
 tea with   
 licorice and  
 a lioness  
 in a       
 cozy den   
 .  That was  
 just asking  
 us all     
 to proof   
 our canvas  
 and liquor.  
 One day,   
 far away,  
 years ago,  
 when life  
 was easy   
 and earning  
 a buck     
 was unnecessary,  
 unless someone  
 woke you.  
 Nowadays, it  
 seems like
 one hundred  
 dollars doesn't  
 buy a      
 loaf of    
 bread with  
 in Europe.  
 However, it  
 does buy   
 time for   
 margaritas and  
 similar bizarre  
 eclectic choices  
 of fun.    
 Today is   
 my birthday    
 , so many  
 happy returns!  
 Happy Birthday!   :)  
 Feliz Cumpleaños!  
 [Thanks, and back to the story where we left off.]

Today is  
 the first  
 of many    
 , many more  
 pleasant days.  
 To-morrow is  
 only a     
 state of   
 an imaginary  
 squirrelene molecule  
 that always  
 runs away.  
 Good grief!  
 Snoopy is  
 flying his  
 doghouse across  
 the sky.   
 in the     
 absence of  
 a parachute  
 scream.  Houses  
 aren't made  
 : they grow  
 and grow   
 into mushrooms  
 with red   
 blotches on  
 and tiny   
 wiggly toes.  
 Toadstools, however,  
 are not    
 home to    
 callers. unless  
 it is      
 warm and   
 relatively sticky.  
 Bananas are  
 usually not  
 straight, unless  
 ironed with  
 extra starchy










{that lion above looks hungry ... and he is looking right at me ...}  
 glue. Apples  
 make great  
 struedel material.  
 Oranges however,  
 are too    
 tart. Strawberries  
 and killer-tomatoes  
 are favorites  
 round here.  
 However, pineapples  
 are prickly  
 or smooth  
 -talking charmers.  
 In April   
 fools are  
 in style.  
 In May     
 styles are  
 more flowery  
 . In June  
 things begin  
 bearing fruit  
 bats and   
 other mysterious  
 little beasts.  
 Take care  
 of your    
 squirrels, or  
 they take  
 care of    
 each of    
 the other  
 life aspects.  
 Rats, on   
 sinking ships  
 run and    
 overtake the  
 the boats.  
 Spreading peanutbutter  
 and mayonnaise  
 on your    
 pizza is   
 sounds yummy,  
 but sticky.  
 "Cheep, Cheep,"  
 cried the  
 budgie salesman.  
 "But we're  
 no longer  
 than we    
 are wide,"  
 quoth the  
 Easter Bunny.  
 Rolling eggs  
 up hill    
 like Sisyphus,  
 for example,  
 builds strong  
 bunny muscles  
 . Gorgons alone  
 prefer hard-boiled  
 and deep-fried  
 Mars bars  
 with Gorgonzola.  
 It must    
 be raining  
 or blowing  
 blizzards out  
 in the     
 park. We   
 should never  
 assume anything  
 that quacks  
 can float,  
 inflated rubber  
 meteorites can't.  
 But meteorites  
 can fly    
 south for  
 lunch. Whereas  
 dinner should  
 stay down  
 wind of    
 elephant's trunks  
 and tummies.  
 Finally, place  
 plaice centrally  
 between two  
 pieces of  
 eight while  
 juggling multi-colored  
 oranges with  
 easter eggs  
 and hatchets.  
 Must you   
 pay attention  
 in lectures  
 , utterly boring  
 speakers droning  
 on about   
 themselves notwithstanding.  
 However, clowns  
 lecturing on  
 balloons are  
 full of    
 hot air.   
 So rarely  
 do we      
 listen to  
 the voice  
 of wisdom  
 and experience,  
 because meteorites  
 interfere. Maybe  
 little clowns  
 should learn  
 how to     
 apply red  
 and vanilla  
 colored paint  
 weekly. Seventy  
 wise clowns  
 proofed seventy  
 blank pages  
 and erred  
 70 times   
 per page.  
 Seventy rabbits  
 carrying seventy  
 Easter Eggs  
 would be   
 quite a    
 popular seventies  
 warren. Nonetheless  
 the gerbils  
 still demand  
 a toll     
 of peanuts  
 and popcorn  
 to use     
 their wheel.  
 Next week  
 stopping short  
 for a      
 cuppa Joe  
 lost his   
 precognition. Keyboards  
 unplugged because  
 they were  
 handing out  
 voice recognition  
 software for  
 blind mice  
 . New glasses  
 will tend  
 to empty   
 rapidly because  
 the yearning  
 for beer   
 is irresistable.  
 Inferior speakers  
 will always  
 pronounce their  
 musical static  
 loudly and  
 unclearly. If  
 the subwoofer  
 tweets then  
 dogs howl.  
 Which make  
 criminals actively  
 slide back  
 in time    
 to the     
 point where  
 the universe  
 comes together.  
 Last Tuesday,  
 for fun,   
 I made     
 tracks for  
 for my     
 toy trains  
 . Today I  
 didn't explode.  
 I'm happy  
 to be      
 me today.  
 Tomorrow is  
 imminent. Custard  
 is my      
 favorite desert.  
 Saharan dunes  
 are hot.   
 Short sentences  
 rock. Long  
 sentences deter?  
 Friggatriskaidekaphobia notwithstanding,  
 Edward Lear  
 was always  
 unafraid of  
 the custard  
 Jumblies make,  
 despite gastrointestinal  
 shortcomings inherent  
 in epicurian  
 potato chips  
 and caviar.  
 Stewed prunes  
 remind me  
 of my      
 science project  
 . Baked Alaska  
 tastes a   
 lot better  
 than steamed  
 army boots  
 au vin.    
 Lions are  
 great! Penguins  
 are better.  
 Wolves however  
 prefer bacon.  
 Aristotle says  
 lions should  
 be found   
 in pies.   
 But, geographically,  
 they belong  
 in Africa  
 , where they  
 usually lie  
 about their  
 age and    
 pretend to  
 be humans.  
 Meanwhile Elston  
 left town.  
 Elston returned
 after a    
 short visit.  
 Nothing happened.  
 Actually, he  
 was too    
 close for  
 the weapon  
 forged by  
 Hephæstus in  
 his dreams.  
 If only    
 life was   
 of cherries!  
 a bowl     
 I wouldn't  
 be so      
 certain, except  
 cherry pits  
 can really  
 hurt if    
 shoot one  
 biscuit fishpaste.  
 Basketball is  
 one example  
 of team    
 sport that  
 requires both  
 skill and  
 peanut butter.  
 Cricket however,  
 needs no   
 trained bats  
 to catch   
 flys, just  
 flying chickens  
 to cheer.  
 Evil looking  
 cricket bats  
 threatened to  
 strike the  
 hour before  
 they return  
 their books  
 to the     
 batting line-up.  
 Five reasons  
 for never  
 washing after  
 cuddling geckos  
 amidst little  
 pools of   
 rosewater are:  
 1) possible  
 2) The Gecko amidst Rosewater Prohibition of Washing Regulations 1627 (The 1627 Regulations) as amended by the Limited Use of a Facecloth Permitted Regulations 1993 (The 1993 Regulations)  
 why not.
[A few more words than two there]  
 Still, the  
 device for  
 limiting words
(so there was - got carried away    but as it was pseudo-legalise I suppose I could  have just joined them all up    )
 broke down.  
 Fortunately, it  
 just proves  
 (,) once again,  
 you can
 get away   
 with anything.  
 To get     
 big shoes  
 on little  
 hooves, you  
 need padding.  
 Panic ensued  
 , complete overhaul  
 of all     
 passanger planes  
 will facilitate  
 greater comfort.  
 Free drinks  
 and pizza  
 for everyone  
 who has    
 middle seats  
 between two  
 Indians fans  
 or those   
 overly friendly  
 proofeaders. Whenever  
 they get   
 suspended underneath  
 the sign   
 of the     
 Mystic of  
 Madness they  
 screem loud.  
 "Bravo!", said  
 Charlie as  
 he cheerfully  
 opened another  
 tin of     
 Spam, with  
 honeyed kumquats.  
 Frog legs  
 taste best  
 uneaten, whereas  
 frogs croak  
 when caught  
 by Englishmen.  
 English women  
 croak when  
 given too  
 much toothpaste  
 when engaging  
 first gear.  
 Somewhere someone  
 someday, somewhat  
 sombrously, shall  
 sell seashells  
 showing scenes  
 seemingly sensuous  
 , sometimes silly  
 , sometimes serious,  
 surely slanderous  
 , surprisingly succinct  
 sometime soon.  
 Quick queens  
 quack queerly  
 , quite querulously,  
 questioning quarantine  
 , quintessential query.  
 Wonder whether  
 whiny wimps  
 whip wicked  
 will work  
 willingly without  
 wages. Is  
 ignoring idiots  
 a crime?   
 It is!     
 Or else,   
 you die!   
 Who are    
 they to    
 criticise our  
 manners?  We  
 should clearly  
 remember Ellston's  
 mantra:  "Joule."  
 Short, but  
 sweet indeed.  
 The phone  
 bill is    
 conducive to  
 wanting less  
 communication with  
 mother-in-law, but  
 drastic measures  
 like cutting  
 meat on    
Fridays should  
 be avoided  
 except when  
 are not    
 far over   
 enough. Alligators  
 bid colleagues  
 bon appetit  
 claims a   
 shy and    
 one-armed bandit  
 with a     
 morbid dread  
 of reptiles.  
 Crocodiles, however  
 are playful  
 when they're  
 very hungry.  
 Nonetheless, shrimp  
 and chocolate  
 should be  
 forever banned  
 as toppings  
 for pizza.  
 Marzipan however,  
 is marvelous  
 with mozzerella  
 and morels,  
 and mushrooms,  
 for making  
 magnificent messes  
 on motorbikes.  
 Trainee torturers  
 try to     
 trick treasonous  
 turquoise turtles  
 tempting them  
 to take    
 twenty-two thousand  
 licks of   
 pistachio gelato  
 with cream.  
 Gather fifty  
 navy-seals dressed  
 before dawn  
 , in tartan  
 socks and  
 kilts, blowing  
 on little  
 toy bagpipes  
 as they    
 paddle backstroke  
 in a       
 blue bathtub.  
 Eating bananas  
 and cream,  
 Gluefoot was  
 slathering some  
 chocolate sauce  
 on his     
 atomic dustbin.  
 Molecular trash  
 migrating snails  
 and earwigs  
 aren't the  
 best food  
 for guests.  
 but give   
 them fudge  
 encased grasshoppers  
 puréed stinkbugs  
 and tomato  
 flavored cockroaches  
 and they   
 gobble appreciatively.  
 Later retching  
 agonisingly, without  
 taking pictures  
 for the    
 local newspaper,  
 they promised  
 nothing. Sharp  
 knives can  
 cut through  
 red tape   
 ,so preventive  
 measures, preparing  
 kevlar tape  
 for administrative  
 type people  
 to use     
 against those  
 who intend  
 to abolish  
 bureaucratic folderol.  
 Speaking slowly  
 isn't sensible  
 unless the  
 speaker is  
 trying to  
 make sure  
 you sleep  
 in your    
 chair. Magpies  
 dashing paprika  
 taste like  
 chicken, if  
 you take   
 the giblets  
 and make   
 sure you   
 blanch olive  
 with them  
 and garnish  
 liberally with  
 chicken flavored  
 cracker crumbs.  
 And be     
 totally oblivious  
 to outside  
 broadcasts about  
 pandas with  
 Bernaise sauce  
 and asparagus  
 they cooked  
 with fruit  
 and walnuts.  
 Oranges are  
 rather like  
 hedgehogs, except  
 on Fridays  
 they're required  
 eating for  
 dwarves and  
 such.  However,  
 cockle shells  
 , little bells  
 and pretty  
 much anything  
 that rhymes  
 with 'smells'  
 can only   
 arouse the  
 maternal instincts  
 in skunks.  
 Woe betide  
 the ignoramus  
 twisted between  
 the jaws   
 of purgatory,  
 abandoning hope  
 beyond here  
 eternally longing  
 for chocolate.    

 Chocolate! Blissful  
 and sensuous  
 spread together  
 almost like  
 halvah, but  
 immeasurably more  
 evocative of  
 life's ecstacy  
 . "Not again,"  
 said the   
 splendid chocolate  
 moose as   
 the heatwave  
 in NY.     
 melts his  
 piece of   
 mind, "I  
 must remember  
 where it   
 sank spoke  
 the walrus  
 while unwrapping  
 yet another  
 herring," said  
 Lewis Carroll,  
 while gazing  
 into the   
 wide open  
 mouth of   
 Devil Duck  
 in terror.  
 The cavalry  
 wearing feathers  
 and pink   
 bow ties   
 looked dashing  
 and silly  
 fillies thought  
 they were  
 learning French  
 fashion design.  
 At New     
 Zealand, turn  
 pike roads  
 plunge off  
 in to      
 the vast   
 fields of  
 red mushrooms  
 that smell  
 like poppies.  
 The fields  
 of Marzipan  
 are rich   
 people's property,  
 so visitors  
 are executed  
 if they    
 pick flowers  
 without permission.  
 More than  
 ever before.  
 Elston, being  
 an elephant,  
 never forgets  
 marzipan storage  
 sheds with  
 ziplock doors,  
 and then   
 armed guards.  
 On tiptoes  
 through the  
 crunchy peanuts  
 and squishy  
 melting banana  
 plantations, huge  
 and gorgeous.  
 Elston tried  
 ice skating  
 , which was  
 a mistake  
 considering the  
 thinness of  
 ice in     
 Tahiti.  But  
 the water  
 was salty  
 tasting with  
 overtones of  
 tuna, while  
 dolphins escape  
 from custody  
 on Mondays.  
 Parachuting without  
 a whig     
 or blindfold
 , while clutching
 a Tory     
 is not     
 Political Correct.  
 Democratically, Elston  
 ordered a  
 Sicilian pizza  
 without speaking.  
 Universal gestures  
 brought him  
 nothing but  
 grief. Pizza  
 with custard  
 and marzipan  
 requires lots  
 of courage  
 and some   
 taste numbing  
 novocain.  However,  
 "Pizza Elstoni"  
 knew exactly
 the measurements  
 of her     
 well defined  
 dictionary entry,  
 with diacritical
 marks swarming  
 all over   
 , aggressively and  
 uncomprehensively humming  
 : "tone fork."  
 The pizza  
 quite understandably  
 was never  
 eaten, because  
 thirteen hundred [--these *are* two words in English, are they?]  
 hungry soldiers  
 all tried  
 to steal   
 the same   
 slice of   
 Mama Mia   
 Pizza Pie.  
 Unfortunately, the  
 waitress could  
 and frequently  
 did steal  
 most of    
 the rest   
 room's supply  
 of feminine  
 sanitary supplies.  
 Kafkaesque metamorphoses  
 happen here  
 frequently. Meanwhile  
 in another  
 continent altogether,  
 29 feet    
 from Atlantis  
 wandered aimlessly  
 along the  
 footpath. Well,  
 those 29   
 profligate feet  
 ambled slowly  
 over to    
 a store    
 credit card  
 raging silently  
 in his     
 personal nightmare  
 involving twenty  
 outstretched hands  
 leaving 9  
 left for   
 milk chocolate  
 and whiskey.  
 Chocolate marzipan  
 Batenburg Cake  
 sounds delicious!  
 And is.    
 Thickly sliced  
 , slightly roasted  
 nut roast  
 will surely  
 kill many  
 dull moments.  
 Elton, for  
 singing such  
 operatic arias  
 gets the   
 loud mouth  
 organ music  
 every time  
 it's piped  
 . Even children  
 are enjoying  
 the rich   
 flavor of  
 marvelous marzipan  
 toasted beyond  
 recognition, whilst  
 those who  
 have good  
 reasons for  
 not trying  
 to be      
 children should  
 at least   
 bite hard  
 , why not!  
 You cry    
 or melt    
 chocolate with  
 salty tears  
 , while strawberries  
 and marzipan  
 are devoured  
 in giant   
 spoonfuls with  
 great pleasure!  
 Rogue elements  
 create dilemmas  
 in unsuspecting  
 meteorologists whose  
 rabid passion  
 for forecasting  
 stirs a    
 unrelenting passion  
 for the    
 forecast weather ...
 clear skies  
 and hurricanes  
 . The rain  
 in Spain   
 in July    
 last year  
 came near  
 a little   
 girl, who  
 plaintively asked  
 for weatherproof  
 Faille Taffeta  
 to use     
 as a       
 raincoat.  White  
 knuckle rides  
 for outlandish  
 prices are  
 still popular.  
 Bustopher Jones  
 regularly spilt  
 atoms with  
 his shaving-knive.  
 A purple   
 and green  
 aura surrounded  
 all the    
 dancing leprechauns  
 that failed  
 to transmogrify  
 the Irish  
 whilst seeking  
 forgiveness for  
 such peccadillos  
 as are     
 usually forgiven.  
 The delicious  
 coffee, served  
 --meteorologically spoken--  
 rain falls  
 from above,  
 then falls  
 rain on    
 thirsty gardens  
 which then  
 bring forth  
 triffids. Unsurprisingly  
 these triffids  
 polinate the  
 land indiscriminately  
 resulting in  
 walking forests  
 of poisonous  
 mushrooms filled  
 with cheese.  
 However, triffids  
 filled with  
 wodka are  
 deliriously happy  
 when eaten  
 by Russian  
 dancing bears.  
 While dancing  
 in the     
 flower fields  
 and joyfully  
 singing in  
 the wrong  
 costumes for  
 several days  
 blissfully unaware  
 of vegetative  
 incursion into  
 the vast   
 wilderness beyond  
 belief. Artichokes  
 from Jerusalem  
 , thorny though  
 wonderful, are  
 unpalatable. Montenegran  
 Vranac growing  
 rampant in  
 his car,   
 sought a   
 cleaning solution  
 vendor in  
 extremis. Desperately  
 rubbing and  
 not remembering  
 early employment  
 in the     
 service industry  
 without gratuities.  
 Schooling is  
 overrated, according  
 to the     
 dolphins of  
 seven seas  
 but narwhals  
 and manatees  
 have degrees  
 of freedom  
 and otters  
 do not.    
 Poor otters!  
 Shouldn't they  
 be like    
 pearls among  
 the ashes?  
 Otter cuisine  
 is known   
 for it's   
 exquisite crunchiness  
 is created  
 by ants    
 who consistently  
 drool over  
 rice crispies.
 Down-side  
 of the     
 menu is,   
 eat broccoli  
 only when  
 you need   
 vitamin K  
 and fragrance.  
 Sound advice.  
 The finest  
 blue chicken  
 doesn't cluck.  
 It clicks  
 and plucks  
 and flaps  
 its feet,  
 but when   
 dancing around  
 the prettiest  
 Maypole in  
 the world,  
 festooned with  
 azure garlands  
 wrapped away  
 in silk    
 and leather  
 , soft as  
 a lizard's  
 throat, it  
 could be   
 that of    
 a strange  
 goose instead.  
 Here comes  
 gooey red  
 fire brigade  
 officers, with  
 bright copper  
 kettles and  
 dull iron  
 nose rings  
 waiting for  
 someone to  
 spontaneously combust.  
 At that    
 precise moment  
 , Elston decided  
 to launch  
 a counter-attack  
 against the  
 invading hordes  
 of gnomes  
 . Only for  
 two of     
 the defectors  
 who seemed  
 quite nice  
 to some    
 wandering penguins  
 wearing tuxedos  
 was incarceration  
 an option  
 or was     
 at least   
 better than  
 socks without  
 their shoes  
 . Being barefoot  
 in the     
 antarctic regions  
 cracks nails  
 and destroys  
 the universe  
 on Fridays.  
 On Mondays  
 he eats    
 rotten eggs  
 so that    
 dark toast  
 will not   
 replace all  
 broken tiles  
 on the     
 roofs. However,  
 July brings  
 every Wednesday
 is followed  
 by another  
 day of
 dancing in  
 birthday suits.  
 Mondays, on  
 alternate weeks  
 we do      
 many useless  
 shaving sessions  
 . Being bald  
 we find    
 outrageously funny.  
 Hair, like  
 that found  
 within folds  
 of blubber  
 various lost  
 souls sport,  
 unwittingly. Asparagus  
 spears dipped  
 in cheese  
 make an    
 amazing sound  
 when thrown  
 against the  
 saucepans hanging  
 in bundles  
 over the   
 gleaming aluminum  
 dance floor.  
 Deep water  
 shopping centre  
 at the     
 mall. Meanwhile  
 Blue Water  
 is excommunicated.  
 But why    
 noone knows.  
 Some speculate  
 it was     
 too blue.  
 Others, that  
 know better  
 know better  
 stutter some  
 Ian cheats 
(shocked Ken)
 almost invariably  
 but Elston  
 dances proudly.

 Homologous isn't  
 anything to  
 do with    
 lottery tickets  
 for mutilating  
 the tar    
 pot on     
 the first  
 floor of   
 a luxury   
 line cruiser  
 whenever it  
 crosses the  
 gulf of    
 a miraculous

One day, ... 
      only recently, 
      the amazing 
      blue sky 
      was falling 
      into a 
      very deep 
      sleep. Elston 
      was at 
      his customary 
      home in 
      jabber.org 
      dancing and 
      distributing chocolate, 
      and liquor 
      when suddenly 
      in ornate 
      splendor, the 
      cat came 
      bursting through 
      and said 
      : talking cats? 
      meow. meow? 
      But Ellston 
      could not 
      understand cattese. 
      On the 
      table, sat 
      Lady Electra 
      and a 
      crystal vase 
      containing milk. 
      Magical smoke 
      wafted from 
      the silver 
      mesh of 
    ?  the gear-assembly







(wrenn punts the story back into motion...) 
      , slip-sliding unctuous 
      oil pouring 
      down the 
      back of 
      her neck 
      and carefully 
      upending the 
      teapot that 
      was brewing 
      unattended.  Then, 
      very slowly, 
      as if 
      he'd never 
      before seen 
      a frog 
      chocolate dipped 
      and rolled 
      in fly-wings, 
      Elston crept 
      across the 
      linoleum, opened 
      the back-door 
      , and looked 
      ravishing, dressed 
      in a 
      purple leather 
      motorcycle jacket. 
      No songbirds 
      or squirrels 
      ever contemplated 
      being so 
      lavishly dressed. 
      Elston called
:dancingelephant: 
      his physiotherapist 
      Fred. Then 
      Fred said 
      "Take two 
      times five 
      gerbils, attach 
      three scintillating 
      disco balls 
      which were 
      hanging on 
      his ears, 
      " not that 
      there's anything 
      quite as 
      succulent as 
      Peking Duck 
      noiselessly gliding 
      through a 
      greasy broth 
      and call 
      your mama! 
      On Tuesday, 
      his mama 
      baked cake. 
      Unfortunately, her 
      favorite cook-book 
      , poorly proofed, 
      said "boil" 
      instead of 
      "stir", so 
      , sadly, the 
      elephant cried. 
      It was 
      nighttime when 
      we drove 
      home from 
      the planet 
      for some 
      unknown reason 
      , and I 
      couldn't see 
      who came 
      to scare 
      the raccoons 
      that ate 
      my toes. 
      The elephant 
      trumpeted his 
      french horn 
      ,which caused 
      pandemonium throughout 
      the Senate. 
      Meanwhile, back 
      and front 
      grew daisies 
      , and these 
      kept pushing 
      and pushing 
      until the 
      the elephant 
      popped out 
      a big 
      bag of 
      in-the-shell peanuts! 
      "I'm allergic!", 
      squeaked Elston's 
      rubber ducky. 
      Love-a-Duck swam 
      up Love-canal 
    ?  &lt;beep!&gt; rule violation -- disregard the previous entry.

away from 
      the swirling 
      drain. Fearlessly 
      blood from 
      (I'm lost) 
      anyone sucking 
      the ineffable 
      tube of 
      incredibly tasty 
      , low carb 
      yorkshire pudding 
      product, then 
      it should 
      not burst 
      in ear. 
      Consequently, the 
      lawyers have 
      jointly concluded 
      that illegal 
      distribution of 
      hairpins to 
      members of 
      the opposition 
      , is highly 
      likely to 
      cause undue 
      pain in 
      the abdominal 
      region of 
      anyone who 
      dares approach 
      and looks 
      through the 
      hairpin bin. 
      Of course, 
      the hairs 
      on her 
      face were 
      intricately woven 
      and decorated 
      with green 
      four-leaved clover 
      and suspiciously 
      devoid of 
      the usual 
      shit. Why 
      the hell 
      she chose 
      his kind 
      doberman to 
      defend the 
      dastardly King's 
      stash of 
      dark chocolate 
      , instead of 
      giant lizards 
      that could 
      shoot lasers 
      blinding the 
      chasing enemy 
      and slicing 
      cucumbers thinly 
      lengthwise. From 
      the north 
      of Spain 
      to the 
      top of 
      spaghetti, there 
      arose a 
      marvelous beast 
      of chocolate. 
      Insofar as 
      the monkey 
      was concerned, 
      who pose 
      no threat 
      to the 
      elephant population, 
      present scant 
      evidence indicates 
      the existence 
      of extremely 
      large gerbils, 
      with enormous 
      scat, smelling 
      the roses 
      near the 
      unbelievably exotic 
      pommes frites. 
      Our hero 
      began to 
      feel that 
      ,in Iberia, 
      the pizzas 
      were lacking 
      enough whypslovens. 
      Myrmidons, however, 
      were in 
      cahoots with 
      double agents 
      spying on 
    ?  the gerbils
[color=green:52a640286c][and what, pray, are whypslovens.  Shorter 
Oxford doesn't help)[/color:52a640286c]
      are coming, 
      with all 
      preposterous buffoons 
      and fanfare 
      . With the 
    ?  ornate yet

      green coloured 
      domed arches 
      splendidly adorned 
      with Hohos. 
      That reminded 
      the giraffe 
      to duck 
      when entering 
      the nebulous 
      feeling of 
      bas-reliefs under 
      a velvet 
      Elvis painting. 
      The giraffe 
      seductively licked 
      my ear, 
      deeply enough 
      to cause 
      an infection. 
      The red 
      hickey on 
      my ear 
      elicited comments 
      like: "What 
      bit you? 
      The reply 
      , delivered emphatically, 
      consisted of 
      "burla blahh" 
      , because I 
      was too 
      tired to 
      spit out 
      the pineapple 
      awkwardly obstacling 
      my tongue. 
      Everyone knows 
      green apples 
      served with 
      maple dressing 
      and custard. 
      But few 
      have heard 
      of fried 
      olives with 
      chocolate topping 
      and anchovies 
      that cure 
      the whitlow. 
      Suddeny, aardvarks 
      actually activated 
      by solenoids 
      and adenoids 
      inflamed, swollen 
      beyond reasonable 
      doubt. For 
      eternity, apricots 
      have conspired 
      to obfuscate 
      and disinform 
      the masses 
      of curly 
      lettuce in 
      the midst 
      of summer 
      festivals honoring 
      the mighty 
      farmers who 
      danced divinely 
      in syncopation. 
      Fireworks added 
      a fascinating 
      background to 
      the celebration. 
      The screams 
      of little 
      squirels, hunted 
      by a 
      [url=http://www.badgerbadgerbadger.com/]badger[/url] who 
      just wanted 
      to be 
      their friend, 
      made the 
      masses scream 
      for more. 
      However, realizing 
      this, the 
      badger promptly 
      left his 
      elephant on 
      the boil 
      that he 
      wore proudly 
      on his 
      left flank. 
      One day, 
      the elephant 
      sat on 
      the badger's 
      bananana daiquiri 
      making squishing 
      sounds and 
      splashing around 
      shattering the 
      silence with 
      orgiastic sounds. 
      Then the 
      bartender fainted, 
      the fencer 
      feinted, and 
      riposted like 
      a rattlesnake 
      while simultaneously 
      juggling slimy 
      snails with 
      the aid 
      of intrepid 
      myrmidons attired 
      indiscreetly.  "My 
      goodness," said 
      Elston, "I 
      have no 
      friends to 
      rebuff such 
      preposterous and 
      yet strangely 
      intriguing creatures." 
      However, earlier 
      Elston had 
      a problem. 
      The problem 
      perplexed poor 
      church mice 
      too; it 
      even befuddled 
      rich dragons 
      and modern 
      Millie (thoughly). 
      Suddenly understanding 
      his predicament, 
      Elston phoned 
      his lawyer. 
      , Snidely Sharkskin, 
      who immediately 
      took a 
      wise descision 
      to drink 
      a large 
      quantity of 
      pangalactic gargle 
      blasters, which 
      when consumed, 
      turned everything 
      wildly hallucinogenic. 
      Even mushrooms 
      and aardvarks 
      were nothing 
      compared to 
      phantom spectres 
      ghoulishly green 
      and purple, 
      whirling dizzily 
      through millenia 
      of legal 
      loopholes. In 
      every tree 
      there crowed 
      Numidian Ravens, 
      their noses 
      ,full of 
      chocolate cream, 
      and jellied 
      eels.  Bananas 
      were involved 
      in a 
      particularly nasty 
      case of 
      monkey business 
      ! Elston leapt
:dancingelephant: 
      , as only 
      elephants can 
      ,unfortunately, landing 
      headlong on 
      Charles Dickens 
      , who demanded 
      an apology. 
      However, Elston 
      didn't respond 
      in the 
      usual manner; 
      but only 
      snortled and 
      blew a 
      seal. Oh, 
      one mustn't 
      expect everyone 
      that finds 
      a new 
      copyright-free work 
      to squeal 
      with delight. 
      Some unfortunate 
      people had 
      stumbled into 
      the secret 
      cupboard which 
      had been 
      darkly camouflaged 
      and well 
      -made by 
      hunderds of 
      carpenter ants 
      from Amish 
      homesteads.  Once 
      they saw 
      my pants, 
      which were 
      the most 
      densely spattered 
      and deeply 
      stained garment 
      that ever 
      was seen 
      , or so 
      it seemed 
      to seven 
      inquisitive mice, 
      who happened 
      along at 
      the opportune 
      moment.  Returning 
      from his 
      mountain climb, 
      Elston's father 
      , who was 
      as kind 
      as a 
      little fluffy 
      blood-sucking 
      mosquito. The 
      Jedi knight, 
      whose father 
      caught rare 
      hamburgers in 
      midair, swung 
      his axe 
      perilously close 
      to Elston's 
      left ear 
      . His earring 
      , encrusted with 
      peppercorns, barnacles, 
      cranberries and 
      those tiny 
      shrimp that 
      are tasteless, 
      except to 
      the old 
      shark who 
      was looking 
      rather ill 
      , flew across 
      Elston's family, 
      displaying remarkable 
      pictures of 
      his favorite 
      trip to 
      Guatemala.  Almost 
      in time, 
      a squirrel 
      darted across 
      the airport, 
      landing heavily 
      , her suitcase 
      filled with 
      clarinet reeds. 
      "Oh!" exclaimed 
      my sister, 
      pointing at 
      the slimy 
      yet strangely 
      enticing fungus, 
      she wanted 
      sauted with 
      wild onions, 
      and slightly 
      mouldy,  green 
      leafy vegetables. 
      Alas! It 
      took more 
      than fine 
      motor skills 
      to catch 
      the herring 
      which was 
      once alive 
      but now 
      a zombie 
      scampering along, 
      whistling "The 
      Little Yellow 
      Flute", which 
      is commonly 
      considered to 
      enrage small 
      birds. Despite 
      several attempts 
      by the 
      police force, 
      which was 
      not known 
      to have 
      a large 
      presence in 
      Elston's neighborhood 
      it was 
      generally known 
      amongst jugglers 
      that gravity 
      rarely reverses 
      without serious 
      hilarity for 
      everybody concerned 
      especially with 
      no trousers 
      . "I love 
      this giant 
      peach," Elston's 
      friend Roald 
      whispered quietly... 
      But is 
      it necessary 
      to scream 
      for ice 
      cream and 
      anchovies? Perhaps 
      not, yet 
      the chimpanzee 
      hates bananas 
      in others' 
      beer.  With 
      great enthausiasm 
      for urban 
      renewal, Elston 
      rented a 
      rhinestone-studded 
      nose-ring 
      big enough 
      for himself 
      and two 
      members of 
      the neighbouring 
      family of 
      wild squirrels 
      to live.

      Distributed Proofreader 
      unmindful of 
      the chewy 
      Proofreading Guidelines 
      regarding naked 
      spellchecking and 
      volleyball. We 
      being clueless, 
      about the 
      oldest profession 
      continued our 
      game of 
      gerbil croquet. 
      Squealing, he 
      ran to 
      the end 
      of time 
      where he 
      stopped to 
      plan his 
      next proofraiding 
      binge. As 
      a member 
      of Citizens 
      Against Unlawful 
      Markup Use 
      , Elston went 
      undercover, sneaking 
      quietly towards 
      the vulnerable 
      underside of 
      the Jabberwock 
      as though 
      he was 
      about to 
      tickle his 
      toes. But 
      no! His 
      pink trunk 
      with legs 
      as long 
      as mine 
      on a 
      3" scale. 
      was validated 
      by comparing 
      gobbledegook with 
      data gathered 
      from Zoroastrianism. 
      So, today 
      something peculiar 
      appeared in 
      Elston's soup. 
      Seven peanuts 
      from Mars 
      danced gaily 
      across the 
      field covered 
      in purple 
      , green and 
      yellow tights 
      and a 
      black silk 
      strapless dress. 
      Scientists could 
      begin to 
      reach for 
      their strangely 
      attractive labcoats 
      before they 
      found that 
      strange smell 
      emanating from 
      the nearby 
      jar of 
      Pooh's hunny 
      with the 
      smackral of 
      nice, creamy 
      chocolate frosting 
      quietly smouldering 
      without anyone 
      noticing. Meanwhile, 
      insanity was 
      brewing in 
      the castle 
      , what with 
      the incredibly 
      short notice 
      to redesign 
      the privy 
      . Two seats 
      ,filled with 
      daffodils and 
      crocuses, provided        
      curious counterpoint 
      to my 
      turreted bungalow. 
      That was 
      not the 
      best way 
      to decorate 
      the most 
      highly valued 
      hovercraft that 
      hovered like 
      hummingbirds sucking 
      rancid butter 
      , but it 
      looked surprisingly 
      unlike a 
      lemming. On 
      his way 
      he jumped 
      like a 
      baby tortoise 
      over a 
      a grain 
      of golden 
      pollen that 
      stuck to 
      his crutches 
      ,which posed 
      a conundrum 
      most bewildering 
      : How can 
      so big 
      a monkey 
      dance so 
      spontaneously with 
      no gloves? 
      He flung 
      the boomerang 
      behind him 
      and grabbed 
      the handy 
      handbook provided 
      . "Don't Panic" 
      , as it 
      is all 
      under control 
      by toothless 
      hordes of 
      witches, who 
      will never 
      again bother 
      to check 
      their hats. 
      The headwaiters 
      and janitors 
      jointly decided 
      to stage 
      an impromptu 
      coup d'etat 
      removing the 
      only hindrance 
      to their 
      hat check. 
      Only if 
      spiny anteaters 
      could dance 
      like Elston 
      on fire 
    ?  ! FIRE! FIRE!




:dancingelephant: &lt;suspiciously eyeing satu&gt; 
      Bring buckets!

-s. (running like the wind) 
      and spades! 
      in spades! 
      fly again. 
      When the 
      minute hand 
      of my 
      grandfather's clock 
      fell off, 
      huge thunderstorms 
      ,together with 
      very realistic 
      and eager 
      beavers armed 
      with oversized 
      slingshots, raced 
      hungrily towards 
      oversized sausages 
      with large 
      umbrellas attached. 
      Meanwhile, in 
      another haystack 
      soggy little 
      mice munched 
      peanuts that 
      were worth 
      , well... peanuts. 
      Charlie Brown 
      didn't think 
      Elston ought 
      to wear 
      lederhosen with 
      high heels 
      , even if 
      Bertie Wooster 
      bought them 
      cheaply from 
      eBay, where 
      he'd sold 
      his favorite 
      pair of 
      plus-fours which 
      Rowan Atkinson 
      suprisingly ate. 
      Bean belched 
      loudly and 
      fragrantly, while 
      attempting to 
      proof tables 
      in Latex. 
      without success 
      because yralih 
      's girls woofed 
      and bit 
      in pantomime 
      all the 
      escaped inmates 
      Oh no 
      ,Elston exclaimed 
      with horror. 
      "Where's my 
      towel?" "Don't 
      reply that!!" 
      yelled the 
      spiders.  "It 
      might go 
      pear-shaped 
      ." Then, suddenly, 
      from nowhere, 
      a beautiful, 
      blue butterfly 
      with green 
      sunglasses and 
      pink flowery 
      stockings, flew 
      out of 
      the insides 
      of a 
      pink spotted 
      stuffed cheetah. 
      Not surprisingly, 
      everything we 
      nullify everytime 
      ends up 
      writhing in 
      blissful joy 
      and enlightening 
      the crickets. 
      Once Elston
:dancingelephant: 
      found his 
      red pyjamas 
      trying to 
      assimilate the 
      wild turkeys 
      into his 
      sock drawer, 
      he decided 
      nothing was 
      sacred anymore, 
      and baked 
      two dozen 
      Chocolate Chunk 
      filled sponges, 
      simultaneously trying 
      to stir 
      marshmallows into 
      his soup. 
      Conversely, the 
      ancient scrolls 
      , reprinted post-1923, 
      and JulietS 
      were discovered 
      heading for 
      the flaming 
      kitchen fires 
      ,slowly devouring 
      every single 
      banana in 
      Elston's pantry :dancingelephant: 
      JulietS cried, " 
      Hurray! The 
      proofers who 
      lost their 
      sight and 
      dress sense 
      have finally 
      invested in 
      ear trumpets!" 
      Obviously, this 
      was [b:b517c8cffc]not[/b:b517c8cffc] 
      what DP-Guidelines 
      said. But 
      the proofers 
      had interpreted 
      "Diacricital Marks" 
      as only 
      some guys 
      writing scurrilously 
      , "I'm Mark." 
      Nevertheless, Mark 
      soon realized 
      every keystroke 
      counted twice. 
      After seven 
      swans swam 
      , singing silently, 
      sideways under 
      starlight, they 
      attentively started 
      sewing superb 
      stuffed shirts, 
      with buttons 
      sparkling sporadically 
      and shimmering 
      like billy-o. 
      The missing 
      mysteriously beautifull 
      molybdenum magnets 
      turned up 
      curiously in 
      the proofer's 
      outbox, never 
      causing any 
      undue irritation 
      to the 
      overworked mentor 
      who suggested 
      that this 
      was unusual. 
      Without any 
      warning, the 
      cherry-picker 
      clicked six-hundred-ninety-two 
      keys on 
      black friday 
      and escaped. 
      The angry 
      army ants 
      attacked the 
      alarmingly agile 
      coding squirel 
      who donned 
      :wink: domed hoods. 
      While this 
      unforeseen event 
      posed certain 
      logistical difficulties, 
      smooth waters 
      soon prevailed. 
      A great 
      , legendary proofreader 
      without coat 
      or broadband 
      connection suggested, 
      that they 
      might enjoy 
      an apertif 
      before disrobing-- 
      ...and so they did.

I just love this. It's tons of fun. 
      A sad 
      DP volunteer 
      was cheered 
      up by 
      dancing on 
      the purple 
      elephants back. 
      "Yes! Oh, 
      oh yes! :wink: 
    ?  
[color=red:1feed0f3ee][i:1feed0f3ee][size=18:1feed0f3ee][b:1feed0f3ee]OH 
YESSSSSSSS!!!!!!![/b:1feed0f3ee][/size:1feed0f3ee][/i:1feed0f3ee][/color:1feed0f3ee] :shock: 
      and yet... 
      I'm lost," 
      he sighed. 
      And promptly 
      took his 
      pink umbrella 
      with the 
      furry handle 
      outside for a walk in the rain. 
    ?  [quote:873f956643]outside for a walk in the 
rain.[/quote:873f956643]
A little greedy, byrd1981 :). We'll just use the first two words of 
that: 'outside for'

a long 
      walk in 
      the rain. 
      Meanwhile, the 
      fifteen gerbils 
      tried not 
      ok so crucify me already. i got carried way. 
      to tread 
      on crosses 
      . Neither did 
      the snakes 
      deem it 
      completely necessary 
       
      to avoid 
      the appearance 
      of being 
      a complete 
      bunch of 
      steamed asparagus. 
      So Elston 
      , being pompous 
      (a word 
      he always 
      enjoyed demonstrating), 
      bought a 
      round-trip ticket 
      to Timbuktu 
      aboard the 
      dirigible, [i:9888d1a7bb]Akron[/i:9888d1a7bb]. 
      Sadly, it 
    ? Sadly, it
[I don't know if it's "sadly" or not, but this thread is turning out 
more like "A sentence, two words at a time" rather than a story, two 
words at a time. Wonder if it looks anything like a story if all the 
sentences are read one after another. But I'm enjoying it regardless. I guess 
we all are.]

was time 
      , not space, 
      was Elston's 
      tune for 
      moments when 
      the pigeons 
      insisted on 
      flying eastwards 
      despite the 
      new guidelines. 
      Meanwhile, in 
      a distant 
      land where 
      no frightening 
      mice ever 
      wander into 
      alternate dimensions, 
      Elston's second 
      -cousin Eloise 
      was listening 
      secretly behind 
      a vine-covered 
      wrought-iron trellis, 
      and overheard 
      an eerie 
      whispering voice, 
      suggesting someone 
      was watching 
      the young 
      squirrels that 
      cavorted merrily 
      near the 
      quaking aspen 
      overlooking the 
      canyon that 
      abruptly fell 
      very far 
      downward into 
      the darkness. 
      "Oh, dear!", 
      she cried, 
      "I simply 
      don't understand 
      how the 
      space monkeys 
      can write 
      such imaginative 
      instructions for 
      connecting to 
      dancing elephants 
      on toe 
      of frog!" 
      Having calmed 
      his Grandma 
      by judiciously 
      applying cold 
      water on 
      her delicate 
      yet firm 
      large aubergines 
      , which despite 
      Grandpa's repeated 
      attempts to 
      divest her 
      of her 
      fruits, he 
      labored over 
      the mental 
      problems involving 
      promoting eager 
      newbies to 
      unreservedly accept 
      beanies with 
      their feedback. 
      " A Beanie!!", 
      cried one 
      eager newby 
      ecstatic newbie. 
      "I always 
      Grandma snarled, 
      "hated gerbils, 
      "too chewy", 
      "don't you" 
      "dare serve" 
      gerbil stew 
      to Aunt 
      Sally!" Elston 
      shivered in 
      delight, for 
      gerbil stew 
      never appealed 
      to anyone 
      but gerbils. 
      "Bring me 
      my porridge 
      to paste 
      your hide!." 
      Intead, Elston 
      nibbled on 
      some crunchy 
      dried mackerel. 
      This satisfied 
      his initial 
      cravings, but 
      left him 
      slurping all 
      the pilsner 
      until he 
      remembered that 
      better beer 
      is often 
      the best 
      shaken, not 
      nearly burst. 
      was rudely 
      and debased 
      by non-sequiturs. 
      Finally, the 
      gurglings of 
      many non-sequiturs 
      burst forth 
      from the 
      magical fountain. 
      Thoroughly sick 
      and fearing 
      for his 
      old life 
      to undo 
      the damage 
      heaped upon 
      the kitchen 
      by exploding 
      the oven 
      right after 
      the cake 
      sagged, Elston 
      ran to 
      the slaughterhouse 
      to die. 
      But when 
      Louise read 
      the instructions 
      she toppled 
      the ungainly 
      wooden statue 
      , preventing it 
      carrying his 
      lumpy elephant 
      to the 
      beautiful garden 
      overflowing with 
      lumpy elephants. 
      It is 
      a marvel 
      that these 
      kind of 
      proofers could 
      rise above 
      petty differences 
      to unify 
      themselves. Hooray! 
      The triumph 
      of overcoming 
      all those 
      space monkeys 
      was just 
      a surprizing 
      twist in 
      an already 
      exciting story. 
      "Alas," said 
      the lion 
      , smacking his 
      large lips 
      wistfully. "If 
      those gazelles 
      would only 
      slow down, 
      bring barbeque-sauce, 
      and pepper 
      while I 
      prepare the 
      barbecue pit 
      for the 
      guests who 
      come for 
      tea and 
      tasty crumpets 
      but never 
      bring flowers, 
      despite their 
      mothers' reminders, 
      I could 
      almost taste 
      my mother's 
      afternoon tea 
      and fishcakes!" 
      Elston contemplated 
      a party 
      and invite 
      d the entire 
      Distributed Proofreaders 
      crowd to 
      wear silly 
      hats only! 
      No spoons 
      were needed 
      when the 
      DPers ate 
      the Turkish 
      Delight which 
      tasted of 
      flavored honey 
      and almonds. 
      Later, when 
      the polkas 
      were scheduled 
      to finish, 
      it transpired 
      that the 
      bandleader decided 
      not to 
      wear any 
      lederhosen. The 
      shocked celloist 
      refused to 
      go home. 
      The police 
      were surprisingly 
      happy to 
      let the 
      protesting environmentalists 
      dance like 
      delerious fireflies 
      until several 
      broke down 
      and had 
      whiplash injuries 
      in pain 
      like fire. 
      they dash 
      --they slither-- 
      to shelter 
      beneath any 
      skirt that 
      lay on 
      warm heads. 
      Just before 
      anybody thought 
      that things 
      had gone 
      awry, Constance 
      quickly stepped 
      behind the 
      concrete pillar 
      that stood 
      in front 
      of Prudence's 
      boudoir mirror. 
      Everyone wondered 
      what next? 
      Eighteen years 
      of slow 
      accumulating guilt 
      finally forced 
      out of 
      him the 
      following admission: 
      "Yes, I 
      am the 
      one who 
      ate your 
      chocolate coated 
      cherry. But 
      our alligator 
      was snapping 
      so playfully 
      at our 
      goldfish that 
      I had 
      neglected to 
      put back 
      the smallest 
      of covers 
      from the 
      fish tank 
      this morning. 
      thus Tuesday 
      spelt doom 
      upon entire 
      generations of 
      his family 
      who were 
      eating chocolate 
      but who 
      carelessly put 
      the chocolate 
      in the 
      paper shredder. 
      "What a 
      shame!" said 
      Elston, (remember 
      he is 
      just this 
      one helpful 
      elephant) decided 
      changes aren't 
      always desirable, 
      only inevitable. 
      Poor Elston 
      thought hard 
      for days 
      , eating tons 
      of fresh 
      plantains and 
      marmite sandwiches, 
      with side-orders 
      of glazed 
      ham and 
      and yams. 
      Then revelation 
      presented itself 
      to Elston 
      like a 
      sock in 
      the face: 
      he didn't 
      belong in 
      such an 
      august group 
      , instead he 
      decided to 
    ?  join Y.E.F.P-C.!




(the Young Elephants in Favor of Peanut-Coladas, of course) 
      This mind-altering 
      business gave 
      a new 
      perspective to 
      the evolving 
      process of 
      baking chocolate 
      with help 
      from gnomes 
      fresh out 
      of school 
      . Henceforth, Elston 
      made sure 
      that his 
      wellingtons were 
      always on 
      and polished 
      whenever he 
      went dancing. 
      Elston's dance 
      instructor privately 
      taught him 
      always to 
      hold the 
      right hand 
      in whypslovens. 
      Even so, 
      the monkeys 
      gathered ominously 
      talk over 
      new strategies 
      re elephants 
      and whypslovens. 
      On the 
      next occasion 
      for dancing 
      we rocked 
      hard to 
      Yanni and 
      God knows 
      what else. 
      Then Elston 
      stretched his 
      trunk out 
      and grabbed 
      a passing 
      albatross, which 
      promptly threw 
      the fish 
      to the 
       
      undercover policeman. 
      I once 
      thought that 
      police officers 
      would be 
      my friends. 
      However, when 
      they started 
      to tell 
      the press 
      about Elston's 
      secret life 
      and loves, 
      it became 
      too difficult 
      for him 
      so they're 
      calling in 
      for take-out 
      of some 
      ice cream! 
      It's delivered 
      by seagulls 
      wearing purple 
      tatted antimacassars 
      on their 
      family's favourite 
      1951 chevy 
      with leather 
      and new 
      steel wheels 
      instead of 
      marshmallows. Sadly, 
      without marshmallows, 
      there was 
      little hope 
      of pudding. 
      that nite 
      as Elston 
      Elston who? 
      danced through 
      the gnarled 
      fence post 
      pallisade, singing 
      , "I'm an 
      octupus you 
      can't see 
      , in an 
      empty cave 
      filled with 
      a surprising 
      sparkling light!" 
      Naturally, this 
      was not 
      quite what 
      the songwriter 
      had originally 
      considered, but 
      she knew 
      it wouldn't 
      discombobulate the 
      ever demanding 
      singers of 
      postmodern pop 
      . During spring-break 
      Elston continued 
      his quest

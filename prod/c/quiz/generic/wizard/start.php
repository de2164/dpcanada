<h2>Quiz wizard</h2>

<p>This small application will assist you in setting up a new quiz. You have to be logged in, or it won't work.</p>

<p>The user interface is probably neither very comfortable nor extremely tolerant.
But using it can fortunately do absolutly no harm to anything else, so you can play around with it
without any danger. </p>

<p>Before starting here there are a couple of steps you already should have taken:</p>
<p><b>1.</b> Decide what you want to include in the quiz. Resist the temptation to
include too much in one quiz. The more you include, the more complicated testing for errors gets.
When in doubt better split it up in two or more separate quizzes.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> Look for or write the text for the quiz.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> Prepare the image. It shouldn't be larger than xxx x xxx pixels if possible.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> Prepare the initial text the user will have to correct.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> Prepare the solution text. If at all possible, try to design the quiz in such a way that 
you can give only one unique solution. If that is absolutely impossible because there is some freedom for 
the proofers in the guidelines, you can give more than one solution, but this will not allow giving the user 
helpful feedback using a diff in some situations.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> Prepare a list of (assumed) typical errors and what hints you want to give when the user
makes them.<p>

<p>Done all that? OK, let's start!</p>

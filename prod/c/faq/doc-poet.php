<h2 align="center">Proofreading Guidelines -- Special Rules for Poetry </h2>
<p> These are special additions to the Proofreading Guidelines for Poetry.
    They were created because poetry is rather specialized, and is often printed
    differently than the prose works that make up much of our proofreading.  So
    we wanted to expand on the poetry guidelines here.
  <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Poetry is often a bit more challenging to proofread than other texts (but often
    more interesting)! <i>Thanks for your help in proofreading these books.</i>

  <ul>
    <li>Insert a new line before the start of the poetry, and type <tt>/*</tt> on it,
    <br>and insert a new line after the end of the poetry, and type <tt>*/</tt> on it.
        (These markers are to help the post processor find the poetry, which has to
        be treated differently.)                                                </li>
    <li>If lines are indented relative to each other, indent them to match.     </li>
    <li>But don't try to <b>center</b> poetry, even if it was centered in the
        printed version.  (That won't work for an e-book viewed with many
        different screen sizes.) Slide the lines towards the left margin, while preserving
        the relative indents.         </li>
    <li>If a line of verse is "broken" because it collided with the right
        margin, join it back into a single line.                                </li>
    <li>If some words are set in ALL CAPS at the beginning of a poem (or each
        stanza of a poem), change them to normal capitalization.  (This was a
        common typesetting convention in these older books.)                    </li>
    <li>Check the Project Comments for the specific book.  Poetry books often
        have special instructions from the Project Manager.  (Many times, you
        won't have to follow all these formatting guidelines for a book that is
        mostly or entirely poetry.)                                             </li>
    <br>
    <li>Priority of guidelines:
    <br>First, follow any special guidelines the Project Manager gives about this
        specific book in the Project Comments.
    <br>Then follow these general guidelines for Poetry.
    <br>Finally, for anything not covered here, follow the standard rules in the
        <a href="document.php">Proofreading Guidelines</a>.</li>
  </ul>

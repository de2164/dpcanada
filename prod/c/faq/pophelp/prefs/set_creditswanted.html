Credits Wanted
</B></TD></TR><TR><TD>
When a project gets posted, several people beside the proofreading team can be credited.
This means that a line such as "Produced by John Doe, Jane Doe and the
Online Distributed Proofreading Team" is included with the final ebook.

<P>You can specify whether or not you would like to be credited for your work in this manner.</P>

<P>CP means "Content Providing" (Deprecated), where we used to record who scanned a book.</P>
<P>IP means "Image Preparing", such as either scanning a book yourself, or harvesting images from an online archive.</P>
<P>TP means "Text Preparing", generating text files from image files, such as through the OCR Pool.</P>
<P>PM means "Project Managing", which means you're sheparding the book through the site (only visible to project managers).</P>
<P>PP means "Post-Processing", which consists of assembling the pages into the final ebook and making e.g. formatting consistent throughout the ebook.</P>

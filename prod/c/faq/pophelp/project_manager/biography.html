How to Use a Biography for your Project Comments
</B></TD></TR><TR><TD>
To use a biography in your project comments you must first identify an existing biography that you want to use or create a new.
At the <a target="_blank" href="../../../tools/authors/listing.php">listing of authors</a>, try to find an existing record for the author. If you don't find one, create a new record. For each author there can be any number of biographies &mdash; you can either decide to use any of the ones that may exist or enter a new biography.

<p>Each biography has its own number which can be used in a special markup like this: <b>[biography=13]</b>. All you need to do to include
the biography is put this in your comments:</p>

<p><i>[biography=13]</i></p>

<p>You may also include other comments in addition to the biography as well as more than one biography.  For example,<br /><br />

<i>For the interested, there's a biography of the author:<br />
[biography=13]<br />
This edition was edited by Humphrey, presented below:<br />
[biography=29]</i></p>

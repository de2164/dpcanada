How to Use a Template for your Project Comments
</B></TD></TR><TR><TD>
To use a template in your project comments you must first create a text file with what you want this template to include.
The text file can include HTML code in it.  After you create the file save it as a 4 letter filename with a
txt extension.  For example, <i>temp.txt</i><br><br>

You will then need to send this file off to a Site Administrator who will upload the file to its proper location and
check for any malicious content.  Once you have been advised by the SA that the template is live all you need to do to include
it is put the following in your comments:<br><br>

<i>[template=temp.txt]</i> -- Where temp.txt is replaced by the filename you have choosen.  Your filename may be different however if someone
else has already chosen that name and the SA will let you know of it in the e-mail you get when the template is live.<br><br>

You may also include other comments in addition to the template as well as more than one template.  For example,<br><br>

<i>This is a beginners project<br>
[template=bgin.txt]<br>
It is also an Scientific America periodical as well<br>
[template=scam.txt]</i><br><br>

You can see examples of current templates <a href="../../templates_guide.php" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>

If you have any questions feel free to contact a Site Admin.

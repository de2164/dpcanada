The following variables are in use (global) outside of classes:

doctype.inc
     $docType = standard <DOCTYPE> header

dp_main.inc
     $cookieC class instance use as $cookieC->setCookie() | $cookieC->deleteCookie()
     $pguser = the username as pulled from the pgname cookie variable
     $db_Connect = class instance of the database connection.  Should do a true or die()
                   test on this variable for pages which rely on a database connection.
     $db_link = the database link returned by the connection

 *** NOTE:  Pages which include dp_main.inc have all $_GET and $_POST variables autoglobal.
            $_GET variables are extracted first and $_POST variables are extracted secondly.
            So, $_POST variables will overwrite $_GET variables with the same name.

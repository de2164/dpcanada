How to create a tab-set resembling that of theme "Project Gutenberg" using Photoshop
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit theme.tpl
* It should contain something like
  $royal_blues['tabs'] = array(
      'background' => '#ffffff',
      'background-position' => 'top',
      'padding-left' => '9px',
  );
* '9px' is the width of tabs_left.png created below and shouldn't need to be changed
* Obviously, '$royal_blues' should be something else
* '#ffffff' should likely be something else

Create background image
* Create a new image, 10 pixels wide and 90 pixels high (approximately)
* Play around with the gradient tool, creating a vertical gradient
* Save as tabs_bg.png

Note: In all of the four files referenced below, you may want to tweak the color of the border.

Create parts of active tabs
For each of tabs_left_on.png and tabs_right_on.png, do this:
* Open the file from the gutenberg theme
* Select the greenish color using the sampler and "Select->Color Range..."
* Fill the selected area with the new color
* Save using the same filename but in the new directory using "Help->Export transparent image"

Create parts of inactive tabs
For each of tabs_left.png and tabs_right.png, do this:
* Open the file from the gutenberg theme
* Select the greenish color using the sampler and "Select->Color Range..."
* Fill the selected area with approximately 70% of the new color
* Save using the same filename but in the new directory using "Help->Export transparent image"

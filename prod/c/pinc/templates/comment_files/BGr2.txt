<p><b><i>Thanks to all the new volunteers who have worked on this book.</i></b> This book has changed from a BEGINNERS ONLY project to a MENTORS project.</p>

<p><b>SECOND ROUND PROOFERS:</b> Please be aware that I promised our new volunteers that "experienced proofers will do a second round. They will send you some friendly suggestions if you are making any obvious beginner mistakes." Remember that formatting issues, with only a very few exceptions, are now being handled in subsequent rounds. <b>Please help by sending feedback and words of encouragement!</b> </p> 

<p><b>NOTE:</b>You can find a list of which beginner has done which page, and  the number of pages proofed by each, at the <a href=http://www.pgdpcanada.net/c/tools/proofers/for_mentors.php> For Mentors page</a>.</p>

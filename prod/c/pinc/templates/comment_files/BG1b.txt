<p><b>BASIC INSTRUCTIONS:</b></p>
<p><b>Here are a few basic instructions.</b> Please consult the 
<a href="http://www.pgdpcanada.net/c/faq/proofreading_guidelines.php">Proofreading 
Guidelines</a> to go beyond these basics. </p>

<p><b>Make the text look like the page image except as 
per below!</b> That means leaving in the breaks at the 
ends of the lines, leaving spelling "mistakes", etc. Mostly 
your job is to fix mistakes left by the Optical Character 
Recognition (OCR) software. Compare the text carefully 
to the scanned image of the page, line by line (or word 
by word, or letter by letter). Please pay extra-close attention 
to punctuation, numbers, and words in ALL CAPS. Run a 
spell-check on your page, and verify that any queried 
words do, in fact, match the words in the scan. Please do 
NOT correct the word in the text if it is a true match to 
the word in the scan. Refer to the <a 
href="http://www.pgdpcanada.net/c/faq/proofreading_guidelines.php#p_errors">Proofreading
Guidelines</a> for more information on handling printers' 
errors and misspellings.</b></p>

<p>---1. If a line ends in a hyphenated word, move the first 
part of the following line up to rejoin the word, then insert 
a line break at the end of the rejoined word. Remove the 
hyphen unless it is a compound word normally hyphenated.</p>

<p><i>Scan Example:</i>
<br>"I say, Graham, do you know what's hap-</br>
pened today? There'll be an awful row about it."</p>
<p><i>Corrected Example:</i>
<br>"I say, Graham, do you know what's happened</br>
today? There'll be an awful row about it."</p>

<p>---2. Leave in (or add) the blank line between paragraphs. 
Do not add paragraph indentation, but if the indentation is 
present in the text box, it is not necessary to remove it.</p>
<p><i>Scan Example:</i>
<br>THE ship moved slowly out of the harbour as Tom Woodward slumped
<br>in his seat and breathed a sigh of relief.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to the package he had dropped next to him on the deck
<br>and examined its label.</p>
<p><i>Corrected Example:</i>
<br>THE ship moved slowly out of the harbour as Tom Woodward slumped
<br>in his seat and breathed a sigh of relief. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to the package he had dropped next to him on the deck
<br>and examined its label.</p>

<p>---3. Remove extra space around punctuation. Make it look like common usage today.</p>
<p><i>Scan Example:</i>
<br>The girl looked at him with tears in her eyes ; she began to cry.
<p><i>Corrected Example:</i>
<br>The girl looked at him with tears in her eyes; she began to cry.</p>

<p><p>---4. Remove spaces in words with contractions like "don't" and "isn't"</p>
<p><i>Scan Example:</i>
"Do n't!" he cried. "You 'll ruin the whole thing!"
<p><i>Corrected Example:</i>

"Don't!" he cried. "You'll ruin the whole thing!"</p>

<p>---5. Fix long dashes (em-dashes) by inserting additional 
hyphen character(s) if needed. Proofread these as two hyphens 
if the em-dash is short and four hyphens if the em-dash is long. If a 
line ends with a dash, move the first word of the following line up to 
"clothe the naked dash", then insert a line break following the word 
you just moved. See the <a 
href="http://www.pgdpcanada.net/c/faq/proofreading_guidelines.php#em_dashes">Proofreading 
Guidelines</a> for more details.</p>
<p><i>Scan Example:</i>
<br>He walked over to the window-a strange look on his face-
<br>and tapped on the glass. "Susan!---- Over here!"
<p><i>Corrected Example:</i>
<br>He walked over to the window--a strange look on his face--and
<br>tapped on the glass. "Susan!----Over here!"</p>

<p>---6. If you have a page with a poem on it, read the <a 
href="http://www.pgdpcanada.net/c/faq/proofreading_guidelines.php#poetry">Proofreading 
Guidelines</a>, to see how to handle it. Set it off from surrounding 
text by inserting one blank line before and one blank line after the poem; 
it is not necessary to preserve indentation or attempt to center lines.</p>

<p>---7. <i>Italics?</i>, Small Caps? or <b>Bold?</b> If the text you are proofing 
includes italics mark-up (<tt>&lt;i&gt;</tt> and 
<tt>&lt;/i&gt;</tt>), small caps mark-up (<tt>&lt;sc&gt;</tt> and 

<tt>&lt;/sc&gt;</tt>)  or bold mark-up (<tt>&lt;b&gt;</tt>  
and <tt>&lt;/b&gt;</tt>)  please leave the mark-up for the formatters to review 
and correct. Proofers are NOT expected to add or correct this mark-up.</p>

<p>---8. Page Headers and Footers: Running headers/footers may include book 
title, author, chapter title, and/or page number. They will be at the very top or 
bottom of the page. Remove these, including the page numbers. See the <a 
href="http://www.pgdpcanada.net/c/faq/proofreading_guidelines.php#page_hf">Proofreading 
Guidelines</a> for an example.

<p>---9. Illustrations? Read the <a 
href="http://www.pgdpcanada.net/c/faq/proofreading_guidelines.php#illust">Proofreading 
Guidelines</a>! Proof the text of the captions, leaving the caption where it falls 
on the page. If the caption text was omitted from the OCR'ed text, please type it in.

<p>--10. Footnotes? Read the <a 
href="http://www.pgdpcanada.net/c/faq/proofreading_guidelines.php#footnotes">Proofreading 
Guidelines</a>! Leave the note where it falls on the page, and surround the footnote 
marker in the text with square brackets, i.e., [1] or [*].

<p><b>SHARING INFORMATION, ASKING QUESTIONS, REPORTING PROBLEMS:</b></p>
<p>This site has an internal message system. Your personal page shows how many 
private messages are waiting in your inbox (in the dark green navbar). Please go 
to the forums and login to read your private messages from round 2 proofers. If you 
have questions that need a more immediate answer, please click on the "discuss this 
project" link above. That will take you to a forum thread that is specific to this project 
where you can see what other new people have asked and can get reasonably quick 
responses from experienced proofers. There are also several other forums that you 
may use to ask questions or make comments that are not project-specific, and still 
others designed for amusement.</p>

<p>This book scanned and OCR'd pretty cleanly, but if you notice recurring OCR errors, 
please post a message in the discussion forum (as described above). That way, we will be 
alert for them in post-processing.</p>

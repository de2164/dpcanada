<h2><a name="procedures_P2"></a>The P2 Review Process</h2>


<p>First, consider carefully why you would want to work in a round that consists mostly of tedious, boring and repetitive tasks that must be performed with complete concentration. Next, try putting every page you work on in P1 for awhile through spell-check. Does this drive you crazy? If so, you do NOT want to work in P2. Finally, look at some of the diffs for pages that you worked on in P1 and see what the P2 proofers are correcting. If you are sure that you've been catching everything, but find that the P2 proofers are still finding lots of problems, then you should really stick to P1. If you still want to apply for P2 access, keep reading.</p>

<p><b>Most Important</b>: Proofers who are requesting, or planning to request, access to P2 should be proofing P1 pages to a P2 standard. While the usual expectation of P1 proofers is that they leave the page better than they found it, volunteers who are requesting access to P2 must show that they can achieve near perfection in their proofing. It is strongly suggested that spell-check be used on all P1 pages that might be considered in this review process.</p>

<p>Page, quiz, and time-on-site requirements must be fulfilled. But then, before a volunteer is given access to P2, a human must review some pages proofed by that volunteer in P1 to see if that volunteer shows the necessary attention to detail for working in P2. I've spent much of the past week figuring out exactly how to implement this review. Following is an outline of my initial procedure. Please note that this is subject to change as I gain experience.</p>

<p>Rather than try to review P1 pages myself, which would be impossibly time-consuming and quite prone to error, I've decided to let the P2 proofers do much of the work. What this means is that when someone applies for P2 access, I will look at a selection of the pages that they proofed in P1 which have also been proofed in P2. I will assume that all pages on which no changes were made by the P2 proofer have no proofing errors. Where there are diffs, I will look at the diff page to see what kinds of changes the P2 proofer made. I will count the number of serious proofing errors that I find, and then compare that to the total number of P2'd pages (including both diff and no-diff) to arrive at an error rate. Please note that not all diffs represent "serious proofing errors". Those folks who have a low number of errors (in proportion to their pages) will be given access. Those whose error rate is too high will be asked to wait awhile before they apply again. Everyone will get a response telling them what determination has been made and on what basis.</p>

<p>That's the gist of it. Now for all the tedious details.</p>

<p>First, the implication of looking at corrections made by P2 proofers is that the pages must have actually gotten through P2. Which means that you can't just decide today that you are going to work to a P2 standard in P1 and then apply for P2 access tomorrow. There will be no accurate data on which to base a decision, because the carefully perfectionist pages won't have made it through P2 yet. Chances are good that, unless you have been working to that P2 standard all along, you would be asked to reapply later.</p>

<p>5 or 10 pages in one easy book is not adequate to show instances of a variety of proofing challenges nor is it really a fair sample of one's work. My current preference is to have about 50 P2'd pages to look at (including the no diff ones) from a range of projects. Again, this will require some time for those pages to get through P2. I know this will be quite frustrating for those who are eager to work in P2, particularly since how long it will take for those pages to be P2'd, and even in what order they will be done, will be completely out of your control. Maybe we'll evolve a different system down the road, but this is how it will have to work for the time being. Anyone requesting P2 access who doesn't have enough P2'd pages to provide an adequate sample will be so informed and the request will be held and checked periodically until a determination can be made.</p>

<p><b>What constitutes a "serious proofing error"?</b> Anything which is unabiguously wrong, in comparison to the scan, at the character level. Some examples, and this is NOT an exclusive or complete list, would be: missed scannos such as tbe for the, 3 for 8, '11 for 'll, etc.; stealth scannos such as "ray" for "my", "he" for "be" and so on; spaced punctuation; quotes attached to the wrong adjoining word; comma/period errors; failure to remove OCR junk such as extra characters (not spaces) at the beginning or end of a line, extra hyphens or periods that result from speckles on the original, etc.; common OCR errors such as 0 for O.</p>

<p><b>What aren't "serious proofing errors"? And how can you say that some errors are better or worse than others?</b> The word error is perhaps misleading. In looking through diffs I've found lots of cases that were judgement calls on the part of the P2 proofer, or that might have resulted from ambiguities. Examples include adding or deleting blank lines; removing spaces within a line; a blank line in the middle of a paragraph (could have come from the browser bug); anything to do with formatting; wrong case for small caps (short term) since it might have been done before the rules were changed; etc. The general rule of thumb will be that if there could be any question or ambiguity about it, it won't be counted.</p>

<p><b>How will I know what was "counted"?</b> As part of the response PM, I will include the title of each project that I checked, and a link to each diff page that had an error, with some identification of what the error was. I'll also give the total number of pages that I used (diff + no-diff). I will NOT be checking the page images, and will be trusting that the P2 proofer was correct. This detail should allow you to see what kinds of errors you made, and will also allow you to let me know if the P2 proofer got something wrong.</p>

<p><b>What if I have done a bunch of "make it better" pages, followed by a bunch of "make it perfect" ones? How will I know that only the "make it perfect" ones are being reviewed?</b> The short answer is that there's no easy way for me to distinguish which are which (other than by the number of errors found). What I can and will do, however, is look at the P2 diff pages in reverse chronological order. I will know the most recent date on which you saved a P1 page for each project and I'll look at projects in that order. But, of course, I'll only be looking at pages that have been worked on in P2, so there will still be an unpredictable amount of lag between when you worked on the page and when a P2 proofer got around to working on it.</p>

<p><b>You will exclude pages that were done under the old system, won't you?</b> Of course. I will only consider pages that were proofed in P1 after June 1, 2005.</p>

<p><b>If my request for access to P2 is declined, how long will I have to wait before I can apply again?</b> We don't have enough data to set a fixed time frame at this point. You will certainly have to wait until another 50 or so of your P1 pages have been proofed by someone in P2. I'm guessing that a minimum time between requests will need to be at least 3-4 weeks, but we'll just have to see how things go as we get the flow through the system evened out.</p>

<p><b>I really want to work in P2 right now, but those darn P2 proofers are taking forever to get around to my pages! Is there anything I can do?</b> Not really. I expect things to be slow and frustrating during this transition period. I plan to put a brief list of suggested projects into the P2 page news, that will allow the quickest action on pending requests. But there are no guaruntees.</p>

<p><b>How can I tell when enough of my pages have been proofed in P2? And also, how can I find my pages to check on them?</b> For the moment, I'll let you know if there aren't enough of your pages done in P2. There are a variety of ways of getting to the diff pages for projects that you've worked on, including clicking on the title of the project in P2, then going to the diff page from the project details page. We are working on ways to make all this much easier.</p>

<p><b>What is the acceptable error percentage?</b> I'm still working that out. I'm inclined to start on the stricter side under the theory that it's always easier to loosen requirements than to tighten them. I'm also still collecting data about what kind of error rates are reasonable to expect from perfectionist proofers. (There's more than one reason to make those seeded folks work in P1.  :wink: ) I will probably start with something in the range of 10%, or roughly 5 serious proofing errors out of 50 pages. Note that there can be more than one serious proofing error per page and that each will count separately.</p>

<p><b>What about the fact that some pages are just plain harder and longer than others?</b> One of many reasons why there's a human involved in this process is to allow for this sort of thing. I'll certainly consider the overall difficulty and length of pages as I look at the diffs and will use that as a factor in deciding cases that are near the threshhold.</p>

<p><b>What if my browser burped or something, leaving lots of errors on a page?</b> Another reason to have a human making these decisions. If I see a pattern of someone who consistently has virtually no errors on other pages, suddenly have lots on one page, I'll suspect an extraneous factor. In a case like that, I'll probably look at more pages than I otherwise would, in order to be sure of the pattern, but I do realize that anyone can have something strange happen once in awhile.</p>

<p><b>Is there an appeal process?</b> Not a formal one. You can contact me if you think I overlooked something or was wrong about something. But if it's only one item out of a longer list, it's not likely to make a difference. I am certainly capable of making mistakes, but I also won't have much patience for unsubstantiated nonsense. Since you are free to continue to apply as many times as you wish, subject to the waiting time between requests, I hope there won't be much need to appeal decisions.</p>

<p><b>Why are you, JulietS, making all the decisions? Won't that be too much for one person?</b> I'm making the decisions because someone has to and at the moment the buck stops with me. I expect that this process will require adjustment as we see how it works. The ever resourceful jmdyck has built me a tool that will makes a lot of this process easier than it sounds. And fortunately I do have a high-speed connection that makes flipping between pages quite easy.  Once I am confident that things are fairly stable, I will delegate some of the review process to a few other people. No, I don't yet know how they will be chosen, and no, you can't nominate yourself.</p>
